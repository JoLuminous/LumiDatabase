That year, the city was graced with a rare snowfall. Families, couples, and friends walked together, their cheerful voices filling the air. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But amidst all the joy, Hitori Gotou stood as an obvious outlier. She didn&rsquo;t fit into this sort of atmosphere, nor any kind of crowd-based environment, but this was far worse than any other occasion. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Hitori had been hopeful about this Christmas. She had envisioned spending it with her bandmates&mdash;even if it was just one of them. It was a longshot she knew, but she hoped they had come to understand her, to realize how much she needed their company. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Specifically, she thought about Kita Ikuyo. The cheerful vocalist of Kessoku Band brought a sickening brightness into Hitori&rsquo;s quiet, anxious world. She changed her, making her feel at least a little more capable of doing things she wouldn&rsquo;t normally attempt. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With Christmas approaching, this was no exception. Hitori had spent days mustering the courage to suggest something casual, like visiting a caf&eacute; together or even sharing Christmas cake&mdash;both things she would probably die doing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But when she&rsquo;d finally attempted to bring it up, when she had quietly mumbled, &ldquo;What are your plans for Christmas?&rdquo;, the answer was not what she had hoped for.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Christmas? This year I&rsquo;m planning to attend a party with my classmates.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That had been two days ago. Hitori, crushed but too shy to admit any of the plans she had been thinking of, had merely nodded and waved it off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, she walked alone through the busy streets, the thought of Kita laughing and chatting with her classmates weighing heavily on her chest. Her phone buzzed with a text from Nijika, the band&rsquo;s drummer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Nijika</span><span class="c0">: &ldquo;Merry Christmas, Bocchi-chan! Are you doing anything fun tonight?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitori stared at the screen for a long time before typing back:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Hitori</span><span class="c0">: &ldquo;No plans&hellip; Merry Christmas.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She put her phone away and kept walking. She didn&rsquo;t really know where she was going, but eventually she found herself in the park. She sat down on a secluded bench, hiding herself to avoid seeing any disgustingly romantic couples. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>She pulled her guitar case off her shoulders and unzipped it, looking down at her instrument with confliction. Maybe she could record a video for her </span><span class="c3">Guitarhero</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;channel? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But as she picked it up, Hitori decided to do something different. Instead of uploading a video, she started an impromptu livestream, setting up her phone to face her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was cold, and very snowy, but Hitori didn&rsquo;t even seem to notice. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>A steady influx of viewers poured in as she began to play various songs. Oddly enough, this was probably the largest number of viewers Hitori had ever seen on her channel. That was most likely due to the eye-catching title she used: </span><span class="c5">HOLIDAYS AND LONELINESS: A BALLAD TO MY FATE. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At first, Hitori didn&rsquo;t really pay any attention to her viewers. But then she looked up after playing several songs and noticed the amount of comments. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m alone too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the same boat, Guitarhero.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Loneliness is forever.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I listen to you play and I don&rsquo;t feel so sad anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;This is a safe space for the lonely ones (me included).&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitori made a small smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Everyone&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As she began to play more songs for her comrades, she started sharing more details about her situation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I almost had a chance,&rdquo; she said sadly. &ldquo;But&hellip; I got scared, and&hellip; my friend&hellip; I think she prefers her classmates over me. She&rsquo;s attending a Christmas party&hellip; but I never even heard about it until I asked her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What a bad friend!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s not bad&hellip; she&rsquo;s just&hellip; I guess she doesn&rsquo;t really&hellip; understand me,&rdquo; Hitori whispered. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;The extroverted ones are always the least understanding of people like us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitori nodded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right&hellip; maybe&hellip; but I want to believe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Is this the first time she&rsquo;s neglected you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well&hellip; she has&hellip; forgotten a date once. We were going to hang out and she&hellip; totally forgot about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So she has a habit of this!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not true. She&rsquo;s just&hellip; she told me it was an honest mistake,&rdquo; Hitori said, though she hesitated. &ldquo;Could it have been&hellip; a lie? Maybe she didn&rsquo;t want to hang out with a water flea like me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t rely on her! She&rsquo;s no good!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah! Who would schedule a date and forget about it later? And with Guitarhero no less?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But&hellip; but she&rsquo;s nice. She isn&rsquo;t a terrible person,&rdquo; Hitori said, shaking her head. &ldquo;Everyone&hellip; what should I do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Free yourself, Guitarhero!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need a friend like that!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;I think you should tell her off! Put her in her place! She&rsquo;s friends with Guitarhero and is wasting the opportunity!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitori frowned. She didn&rsquo;t know whether these messages were comforting or concerning. But either way, she just kept playing her guitar. At this point, a few people had come to watch her play from afar, though Hitori didn&rsquo;t notice, deliberately so. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she meant to hurt me,&rdquo; Hitori said after a while, addressing her audience. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just&hellip; so bright, so full of energy. I&rsquo;m the complete opposite. Maybe I&rsquo;m just dragging her down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The chat erupted in protest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;No way!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not dragging anyone down!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitori hesitated. &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s always been kind to me&hellip; Maybe I&rsquo;m the one who doesn&rsquo;t understand her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She looked down at her guitar, feeling the familiar weight of self-doubt settling in her chest. &ldquo;Maybe I just&hellip; don&rsquo;t belong anywhere.&rdquo;</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meanwhile&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nijika watched the livestream with a conflicted expression. At first she was surprised to see Hitori of all people streaming, but as she watched the interactions that took place and read the chat&hellip; she was becoming worried, and also a bit angry. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t good,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Not good at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ryo appeared by her side with a nod. &ldquo;Live streaming in the snow&hellip; that&rsquo;s kind of rock isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not now, Ryo!&rdquo; Nijika snapped, her voice tinged with frustration. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see what&rsquo;s happening here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ryo tilted her head, her usual calm demeanor unshaken. &ldquo;Yeah, I see it. Everyone&rsquo;s really leaning into the whole &lsquo;introverted loner&rsquo; thing. They&rsquo;re eating it up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the problem!&rdquo; Nijika exclaimed, her voice rising. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not helping&mdash;they&rsquo;re making it worse! Look at those comments&mdash;they&rsquo;re just feeding her insecurities.&rdquo; She leaned closer to the screen, her fingers gripping the edge of the desk. &ldquo;Kita-chan probably didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt her, but now Bocchi-chan&rsquo;s convinced she&rsquo;s&hellip; she&rsquo;s not good enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ryo shrugged, unfazed. &ldquo;I mean, she&rsquo;s always kind of thought that, hasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is different!&rdquo; Nijika said, exasperated. She let out a heavy sigh. &ldquo;Seriously, what was Kita-chan thinking? Going to some party without even telling Bocchi-chan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ryo crossed her arms, nodding thoughtfully. &ldquo;Yeah, she does tend to get swept up with people. Kita&rsquo;s got that shiny, popular thing going on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&hellip; idiot.&rdquo; Nijika shook her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m calling her. She needs to hear exactly what I think about this.&rdquo;</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kita sat in a crowded Karaoke room, singing with her classmates. She never hesitated to have fun with other people. It was just in her nature. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But a small voice in the back of her mind told her that she was missing something. She had noticed the way Hitori&rsquo;s face dropped when she mentioned going to this party. At the same time, she didn&rsquo;t think too much of it. Had she missed a key detail? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment, she heard her phone ring. She checked it and saw that Nijika was calling. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a call,&rdquo; Kita announced to the group, her tone light but with an underlying urgency. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She quickly excused herself, stepping into the hallway away from the noise. She pressed the phone to her ear, already feeling a bit apprehensive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kita-chan, you&rsquo;re an idiot!&rdquo; Nijika&rsquo;s voice blared through the speaker, sharp and harsh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kita flinched, taken aback by the sudden outburst. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a nice way to start a phone call.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good. You deserve it!&rdquo; Nijika snapped, her voice tight with frustration. &ldquo;Have you even looked at YouTube today? You better, you sociable dummy!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kita raised an eyebrow, momentarily confused by the outburst. &ldquo;Why are you calling me just to yell? Fine, fine, I&rsquo;ll check.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Without waiting for another response, she pulled up her YouTube app and scrolled through the notifications. Her eyes froze when she saw the one that caught her attention: </span><span class="c5">Guitarhero is live: HOLIDAYS AND LONELINESS: A BALLAD TO MY FATE.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her heart dropped. &quot;Hitori-chan is live?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been </span><span>live</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for the past hour!&rdquo; Nijika&rsquo;s voice crackled, full of urgency. &ldquo;Go watch it, now. You&rsquo;ll see what I mean.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kita&rsquo;s brows furrowed. &ldquo;But why would&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Just do it!&rdquo; Nijika interrupted, her voice harsh with worry. &ldquo;Watch it, and maybe then you&rsquo;ll get why I&rsquo;m pissed off at you!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a frustrated sigh, Nijika hung up before Kita could respond.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kita stared in confusion at the phone for a moment. She hadn&rsquo;t expected Nijika to scream at her as soon as she answered, and she had no idea why the drummer was even angry in the first place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She shook her head and then quickly clicked on the notification, her heart pounding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The stream loaded, and the sight of Hitori sitting alone on a snow-covered bench filled Kita&rsquo;s screen. Her friend&rsquo;s pink coat was dusted with snow, her hands slow as she strummed her guitar. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The chat was scrolling rapidly, a mix of encouragement and misguided advice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m alone too.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t rely on your so-called &lsquo;friends!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Forget her, Guitarhero. She doesn&rsquo;t deserve you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kita&rsquo;s chest tightened. Were they&hellip; talking about her?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitori&rsquo;s voice cracked slightly as she spoke between songs, her words heavy with emotion. &ldquo;Maybe she doesn&rsquo;t really care about me. Maybe I&rsquo;m just&hellip; not interesting enough to keep her attention.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kita&rsquo;s heart dropped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true, Hitori-chan!&rdquo; she whispered to her phone, even though she knew her friend couldn&rsquo;t hear her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One comment caught her attention, making her stomach twist:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need her. Free yourself, Guitarhero!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, no&hellip;&rdquo; Kita muttered under her breath. She wanted to shout at the chat, to defend herself, but there was no way to do that without making things worse.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitori began playing another song, her voice softer and more emotional than usual, and in Kita&rsquo;s eyes, it was hauntingly beautiful. She always thought that Hitori should sing more often, but&hellip; why did she sound so sad? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Did Kita really hurt her? But it was just a simple party, and she had already agreed to go&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then she saw a comment that opened her eyes. It was simple, but she couldn&rsquo;t find any fault in what they said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If she was a true friend, she would have canceled those plans and hung out with you as soon as she saw how sad you were.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kita finally understood. It was natural for her to make plans with one group and turn down another; after all, she was friends with a lot of people, so of course she would end up only able to hang out with a few at a time. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Hitori wasn&#39;t the same. For one, Kita really cared about her, more than she would admit. Second, Hitori was the kind of person who always felt insecure, she didn&rsquo;t have many friends, so the ones she did have were special to her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitori Gotou&mdash;the girl who hesitated when saying everything&mdash;had been confident enough to ask the extroverted Kita Ikuyo about Christmas. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, she had treated Hitori like any of her other friends, forgetting that Hitori wasn&rsquo;t like them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kita clenched her fists, a mix of determination and guilt welling up inside her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m such an idiot,&rdquo; she whispered, her voice breaking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She didn&rsquo;t hesitate any longer. Shoving her phone into her pocket, she hurried back into the karaoke room. Her classmates barely had time to register her abrupt return before she grabbed her coat and scarf.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kita-chan, where are you going?&rdquo; one of them called out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Sorry! I have to go. Something&hellip; </span><span>really</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;important came up!&rdquo; Kita replied, her voice firm despite the turmoil in her chest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ignoring their curious questions, Kita slipped out the door and into the cold winter air. She had no idea how to make things right, but it didn&rsquo;t matter. She had to try for Hitori&rsquo;s sake. </span></p><hr><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitori gave her final farewells as she ended the livestream, placing her guitar back in its case. Guitarhero had been a fun distraction, but she still couldn&rsquo;t help feeling sad. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where was Kita at that moment? Was she singing Christmas songs with her friends? Was she having fun without Hitori?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Despite ending the stream, Hitori couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to leave the bench. It was like a bubble, a shield from the outer world, the outer turmoil. She took her guitar back out of the case and started playing again. She needed to be focused on something else&hellip; something else&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her playing was good, as always, but this time it reflected her inner melancholy. Perhaps it was an epilogical ballad, a continuation of what had come before. But it lacked her usual rock style&hellip; even the most depressing rock songs contained powerful melodies. This one, however, was slow, methodical, and dreary on an entirely different level. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hitori-chan,&rdquo; a voice called from above. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitori froze mid-strum, her head snapping up. Her wide eyes met Kita&rsquo;s, and for a moment, neither of them spoke. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Part of her wanted to admonish Kita for abandoning her, for tossing her aside in order to go to the party. But Hitori couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to do that. She wasn&rsquo;t brave enough to say that. Her bravery had already been used up that month when she asked about Christmas a few days ago. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kita wanted to say something too, a thousand apologies, offers for making up for her mistakes. But she was scared of saying the wrong thing. What could she say that wouldn&rsquo;t upset Hitori further?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;K-Kita-san?&rdquo; Hitori finally broke the silence, her voice barely above a whisper. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kita offered a sheepish smile, holding up her phone. &ldquo;I saw your livestream.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitori blushed and turned away, her hands shaking. &ldquo;Y-you were watching?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kita nodded, taking a hesitant step closer. &ldquo;I&hellip; I heard everything, Hitori-chan. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitori looked down, her hands squeezing her guitar. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to apologize, Kita-chan. It&rsquo;s my fault. I&rsquo;m just&hellip; not brave enough to say the things I want&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Kita said, her voice firm but gentle. She sat down beside Hitori, feeling even more guilty upon realizing how cold it felt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one who messed up. I always seem to&hellip; treat you like my other friends, Hitori-chan, but I know you aren&rsquo;t like them. You&rsquo;re special, Hitori-chan, and I should&rsquo;ve realized how much courage it took for you to ask me about Christmas. I&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t think about how my actions might affect you, and&hellip; I&rsquo;m really, really sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitori glanced at her and then frowned. &ldquo;But you always have fun with your classmates,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to ruin that for you&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have ruined anything,&rdquo; Kita said earnestly. &ldquo;Have I told you how much you mean to me? You&rsquo;re an important friend, Hitori-chan. If you&rsquo;re feeling lonely or hurt because of me&hellip; I want to know. I want to be there for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitori stared at her in disbelief, unsure of how to take these words. &ldquo;You&hellip; care about me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Of course I do.&rdquo; Kita smiled warmly and, without hesitation, pulled Hitori into a hug. &ldquo;And if you&rsquo;ll let me, I&rsquo;d like to spend the rest of Christmas Eve with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitori shook her head frantically, imagining terrible scenes in which Kita&rsquo;s fans killed and tortured her because she took away their precious idol. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Y-you don&rsquo;t have to&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;I </span><span class="c3">want</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to,&rdquo; Kita said firmly. &ldquo;I want to make it up to you, for Christmas, for all the times I&rsquo;ve been careless&hellip; I want to start spending more time with you, Hitori-chan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitori wanted to object, but she couldn&rsquo;t help slightly smiling at her words. Too bad for Hitori&rsquo;s anxiety, but she was selfish when it came to Kita.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you, Kita-chan,&rdquo; she whispered, trying desperately to hold back tears (it wasn&rsquo;t working at all). </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Kita smiled and </span><span>brushed</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a tear from Hitori&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to thank me,&rdquo; she said softly. Then, with a playful grin, she added, &ldquo;Now, what do you say we go to karaoke? I know a great place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh&hellip;&rdquo; Hitori was prepared to throw out a dozen introverted excuses at this, but as she considered her true feelings on the matter, she realized&hellip; who cares? She was going to spend time alone with Kita and that was what she wanted. &ldquo;O-okay. That might be&hellip; fun.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kita eyed her with a doubtful look. &ldquo;Are you sure? I don&rsquo;t want you to feel pressured&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I want to go,&rdquo; Hitori said, in a rare showing of confidence. Wow, that was the second time that month. &ldquo;I want&hellip; to spend Christmas with you, Kita-chan. It doesn&rsquo;t matter where we go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hitori-chan&hellip;&rdquo; Kita&rsquo;s face turned red, and not just from the cold.
