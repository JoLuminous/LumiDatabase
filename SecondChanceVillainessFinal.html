her evil actions. Never once did she allow herself to feel a shred of guilt, nor did she think her poor choices were unwarranted. But the moment she sees her parents and siblings punished upon the blades of death, she feels a wave of anguish. Memories of the past appeared before her, reminding her of the people she used, the terrible schemes she hatched, and those she hurt. The pain of it all setting in, Rosalind wonders why she took this path. Why did she destroy herself and those she loved? As Rosalind faces her death in guilt-filled tears, she wishes for a second chance, for the opportunity to correct the terrible choices she&rsquo;s made. The blade falls&hellip; but then she wakes up, her surroundings different, her age younger. Finding herself three years in the past, Rosalind decides to make a change.

The heroine, with her pure heart, rises above trials and hardships. The villainess, driven purely by jealousy, seeks to tear her down. In the end, the heroine prevails, and the villainess faces her inevitable demise, punished for the havoc she has wrought.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind Harcourt was one such villainess. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She thought herself invincible from all consequences, acting for what she perceived as her given right. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the favored daughter of a powerful noble family and the consort of the crown prince, she believed it was perfectly fair that hindrances were dealt with. All the power in the world was at her command, of course she thought she could have everything she wanted. And when jealousy crept into her heart, it twisted her until all reasonable thought faded from her mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was only natural, Rosalind thought. She had simply acted in the name of love. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But now, as she sat in a cold, damp prison cell, she wondered if she had ever truly known what love was. What good had it done her? What had her love for Prince Vicente brought her, aside from this never ending misery?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind stared dead-eyed through the iron bars of her prison. The walls around her were old and aging, most likely filled with dirt and grime from years of usage. There were no windows, no sources of light aside from a tiny square that could barely be considered a window at all. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her clothes, once vibrant silks and fine lace, were now reduced to rotten dirty rags. How many others had worn these same threads in the face of their punishments? Her hands, once soft and manicured, were now pale, cracked, and filthy. Her nails, which she used to keep polished to perfection, were jagged and broken, remnants of the life she once led.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She couldn&rsquo;t remember how long she had been imprisoned. Weeks? Months? Time had lost all meaning. At first, she had tried to keep track, to count the days as they passed, but after a while, it seemed pointless. No one was coming to rescue her. No one would plead for her pardon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not that there was anyone left to do so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her mind circled back to that awful day, the day everything crumbled beneath her. She had stood, defiant and proud, watching as the royal court passed judgment on her. Her family had stood behind her, unwilling to believe that their beloved daughter, their Rosalind, could be capable of such cruelty. They had been wrong. She knew as much. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She didn&rsquo;t want them to try and defend her, to make excuses for her actions. There were no excuses. But Rosalind was their daughter. They defended her to the very end. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And because of her, they had paid a terrible price. One by one, they had fallen&mdash;her parents, her siblings, and even the servants who she used without mercy. All because of her foolish, selfish actions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind squeezed her eyes shut, trying to block out the images of their lifeless bodies, but the memories were burned into her mind. She could still hear the terrified screams of her sister Eliza, could still see the horrified look on her mother&rsquo;s face, could still feel the cold steel of the prince&rsquo;s gaze as he condemned her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No one had come to her aid. No one had tried to stop it. Why would they? She was the villainess, after all. She deserved her punishment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind let her head fall back against the stone wall, the cold pressing into her scalp. She had replayed that day in her mind a thousand times, every agonizing moment of it. The blood. The screams. She could still remember how long it took for Eliza to die. That little girl had been so scared, she didn&rsquo;t want to end up like the others. But in the end she had the same fate. Was this all worth it for revenge? For the sake of some foolish love?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s lips twisted into a bitter, broken smile. No, love had nothing to do with it. She had never truly loved Prince Vicente. She had wanted him. Desired him, yes. But love? She realized now that she hadn&rsquo;t known love, not really.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sound of footsteps echoed down the hallway, breaking through her thoughts. Heavy boots against stone. They were coming for her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The door to her cell creaked open, and a guard stepped inside, his face impassive. He said nothing as he grabbed her arm, yanking her to her feet with more force than necessary. Rosalind didn&rsquo;t resist. There was no point. She had long since resigned herself to her fate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they walked down the dim corridor, Rosalind&rsquo;s body moved mechanically, as though it no longer belonged to her. Her mind drifted. She had always known it would end this way. It was the nature of stories. The villainess never saw a happy ending.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They reached the doors that led to the stage of her demise, and the guard shoved her forward. Rosalind stumbled but regained her footing just in time to see the blood-streaked wooden planks beneath her feet. The sight of it made her stomach churn. The blood of others&mdash;other traitors, criminals, and now her own family&mdash;dripped down like red curtains at the end of a play.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind laughed, though it came out as more of a hoarse, ragged cough. The irony wasn&rsquo;t lost on her. Here she was, being led to the end, where the villainess faces due justice. And once that justice fell along with the sharp blade, the curtains of the play would fall too. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No one would mourn her. No one would miss her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The crowd that had gathered was silent, waiting for the inevitable. Rosalind glanced around and recognized many of the faces&mdash;nobles who had once bowed to her, servants who had once feared her. Now, they looked at her with disdain, with hatred. Part of her wanted to curse them, to tell them to turn away, but she knew they had every right to watch. She had wronged them all, and now they would see her punished.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But as she was led onto the stage and placed in the brace, as her eyes caught sight of the sharp, glistening blade above her that would end her life, a new sensation washed over her: fear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She didn&rsquo;t want to die.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her breath caught in her throat, her chest tightening with panic. The sight of the blade, hanging menacingly above the platform, sent a chill through her bones. Her legs felt weak, and she stumbled backwards. The man holding her held her tightly in place without mercy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it wasn&rsquo;t just fear that gripped her. It was something else. A deep, painful sadness that twisted in her gut.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She hadn&rsquo;t wanted this. She had never wanted her family to die. She had never wanted her sister, her sweet Eliza, to suffer. But they had&mdash;all because of her. She had prepared herself for this, she was ready to resign herself to the inevitable, but now in the face of it, she hesitated. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She didn&rsquo;t want to die.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tears welled up in her eyes as she heard her sentence being read out to the crowd, her knees buckling beneath her. She stared at those watching below and then up at the blade that would soon see her end. For the first time in years, Rosalind felt completely powerless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Rosalind whispered, her voice so soft it was almost lost in the noise of the crowd. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want you all to die for me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there was no one there to hear her. No one was there to forgive her, no one was there to comfort her, and no one was there to wipe her tears away. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind had created her own loneliness. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And she didn&rsquo;t want to die. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then again, neither had the people who had died because of her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She closed her eyes, bracing herself for the end. She had lost everything. She had been a fool. And now, she would pay the price.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sharp sound of the blade being released cut through the air, and in that final moment, Rosalind&rsquo;s thoughts drifted not to herself, not even to the prince who had once been her obsession, but to her little sister. Eliza.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Eliza,&rdquo; Rosalind whispered, knowing the words were futile. Eliza wasn&rsquo;t here. No one was here to hear her apology. It was too late. Too late to make amends. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even at the end, she couldn&rsquo;t tell her family how much she had loved them. Perhaps she was scared of facing their judgment. Would they have accepted her love, knowing the terrible things she had done? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maybe if she had told them, it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt so much. Perhaps if she had laid her heart bare, if she had been honest with them&mdash;honest with herself&mdash;the weight of her guilt wouldn&rsquo;t be this unbearable. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But no, it still hurt. Even at the end, it still hurt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The blade struck, and the world went dark.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c15" id="h.qwrsj3pwpnv5"><span class="c21 c24">Interlude 1 - Second Chances (original poem)</span></h3><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Second chances are fleeting </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">They aren&rsquo;t always earned</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">But when they are given</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">They can last a lifetime</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Second chances are opportunities</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">They allow you to change</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">They allow you to make amends</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">But they don&rsquo;t grant you immunity</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The sins of the past never fade</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">For they shall haunt you </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">That is the price to pay </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">What would you do with a second chance?</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Many often ask this question</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">But few find the answer </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Second chances are stinging</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">They make you realize what you missed</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">As there is only one &ldquo;first chance&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The rest are broken chances</span></p><p class="c12 c6"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c22" id="h.47rq13klcr5o"><span class="c18">Chapter 2 - Impossibilities</span></h2><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It was impossible. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rosalind blinked, her heart pounding in her chest as her gaze swept across her surroundings, trying to make sense of the impossible. How could this be? She had felt the cold bite of steel, the weight of guilt crushing her chest as her life slipped away. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And yet&hellip; here she was.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She was back in her old bedroom. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Morning light filtered through the windows, casting a warm glow over the familiar room. The ornate canopy bed with its purple drapes, the mahogany vanity where she often prepared herself for battles amongst the other noblewomen, the grand mirror that reflected her undeniable beauty&mdash;it was all there, exactly as it had been in the past. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">All of the lavender colored ornaments she had collected over the years, but were confiscated&hellip; They were there too. She had always loved the color lavender, but now, it all felt alien. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11">How could this be real?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rosalind clutched her arms tightly around herself, trying to quell her trembling. Her breaths came in ragged gasps, and her eyes darted around the room frantically, as if expecting it to crumble before her, revealing its illusion. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The cold, damp prison cell, the screams of her family, the sins she had made&mdash;those were all real. They had to be, right?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16">Or&hellip; w</span><span class="c0">as it all a dream? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">No, it couldn&rsquo;t be, everything was too vivid, too realistic, too&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rosalind whimpered, the sound slipping from her lips before she could stop it. How could she be here? After everything she had done? This was not what she deserved. It was not fair.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11">I don&rsquo;t deserve this!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She had felt the weight of her guilt, and had seen the consequences of her actions. The blood of her sister, her parents, her siblings, her servants&mdash;all of it was on her hands. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">How could she live on without them, knowing they were gone? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her breath hitched in her throat as the door to her bedroom creaked open, pulling her from the spiraling thoughts that threatened to overwhelm her.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My lady, are you awake?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rosalind froze.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Her heart pounded in her chest as her gaze snapped to the door. A figure entered, moving with practiced grace. The familiar sound of light footsteps, the gentle white skirt&mdash;she had always relied on her maids for her evil deeds&mdash;but the sight of this maid made her stomach twist in knots. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She couldn&rsquo;t stop the shaking that engulfed her body. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16 c17">Bethany&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The maid who had been with her since childhood, who had followed every order and faced the full brunt of Rosalind&rsquo;s wrath. Before, she was nothing but a scapegoat, a pawn who could take the fall when needed. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But upon seeing her cold, lifeless body, Rosalind had realized how much Bethany cared about her. Even at her end, Bethany had been on Rosalind&rsquo;s side. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16">None of that mattered now, though. She</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;had died along with the other servants, just another unfortunate casualty. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And yet, here she was. Alive. Smiling. Serving tea.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rosalind couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to move. She couldn&rsquo;t breathe. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11">This can&rsquo;t be real.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The maid walked to the side of the room and set the tea tray on the table, as if nothing had changed. As if the world around her hadn&rsquo;t crumbled. As if Rosalind hadn&rsquo;t destroyed everyone she had known. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bethany&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind whispered, her voice trembling. Her throat tightened painfully as she uttered the word.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Bethany glanced up at her curiously, her brows furrowing in concern at Rosalind&rsquo;s pale face. &ldquo;My lady, are you unwell?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She stepped closer, placing a hand on her forehead. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to have a fever. Shall I fetch the physician? You look as though you&rsquo;ve seen a ghost.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A ghost.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11">Bethany&hellip; you&rsquo;re the ghost&hellip; you&rsquo;re not supposed to be alive.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rosalind couldn&rsquo;t take her eyes off her. Every fiber of her body screamed that this was wrong, that this shouldn&rsquo;t be happening. Her thoughts were spinning, she wanted to scream out, to chastise Bethany, but what had she done wrong? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Was this some sort of cruel punishment? Was this a prison in hell where she would be forced to watch the people she failed living lives that they never could because of her? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Or was this something else?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rosalind swallowed hard and took a deep breath. Her voice shook as she slowly asked, &ldquo;Bethany, what year and day is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16">Bethany blinked, clearly surprised by the odd question, but she answered dutifully, &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s the 24th of Springtide, my lady. The year is 1432, of course.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rosalind held a hand over her mouth in disbelief. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11">Three years.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She had gone back in time, three years before everything had gone so horribly wrong. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This was real. Somehow, impossibly, she had been given a second chance at life. But how? Why? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Her body trembled violently as the weight of this revelation settled over her like a suffocating blanket. Did she deserve this? Could she fix the pain she had caused? Could she stop herself from succumbing to the terrible envy that once consumed her? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Could she&hellip; save her family? </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&quot;My lady?&quot; Bethany&rsquo;s soft voice broke through her thoughts, bringing her back to the present. &quot;The lord and lady are waiting for you in the dining room. Shall I clean you up?&quot;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rosalind nodded, her hands dropping to her sides. As Bethany dressed her up for breakfast, Rosalind considered the truth of her surroundings. Her fingers clenched into shaky fists. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11">I can stop it. I can save Eliza.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But was she ready to face them? Could she see the living faces of her family without breaking? She nearly broke when she saw Bethany. What would happen if she saw those closest to her?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rosalind braced herself as she stood at the doors to the dining room. Behind those doors were the family she had once doomed. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The doors opened slowly, and Rosalind&rsquo;s breath caught in her throat.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Her parents. Her brothers. And most of all&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rose you&rsquo;re awake!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16 c17">Eliza&hellip;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Her little sister, staring at her with that warm, comforting smile she had always worn. The smile Rosalind lost at the end of it all. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Tears blurred Rosalind&rsquo;s vision, spilling over before she could stop them. Eliza was alive. But why did it hurt so much to see her? Why did the sight of her sister, smiling and happy, fill Rosalind with such unbearable sorrow?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rosalind, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Her mother&rsquo;s concerned voice broke through the haze of emotion. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rosalind quickly wiped her face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. I was just&hellip; thinking about something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She walked over and sat at the table, her nerves still shaken. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As they began to eat, an eerie quiet settled over the dining room. No one knew where the tension was coming from, but Rosalind felt uncomfortable. She couldn&rsquo;t eat her food with her family next to her. Not when their deaths were so firmly engraved in her brain. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rose, are you okay?&rdquo; Eliza asked, noticing her deathly expression. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Rosalind lied. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16">&ldquo;Really? But you&rsquo;re so pale. You look like you&rsquo;ve seen a </span><span class="c21">ghost</span><span class="c0">,&rdquo; Rosalind&rsquo;s mother said. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rosalind frowned. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There was that word again. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c16 c17">A ghost.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They were all ghosts, even Rosalind. They were all supposed to be dead. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Rosalind shook where she sat, her palpitations clearly visible. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered, tears building in her eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A gentle hand rested on her shoulder, and Rosalind flinched instinctively. Looking up to see Eliza glancing over at her in confusion, she frowned. She didn&rsquo;t want comfort, especially not from Eliza. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rose, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Eliza asked, her voice soft and hesitant. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re scaring me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind felt her heart twist painfully in her chest. Scaring her? That was nothing compared to everything else she had done. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no room for pity. Rosalind simply didn&rsquo;t want it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">If you want to have any feelings for me, please let it be hate. Don&rsquo;t show me sympathy. I was a perpetrator, not a victim. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind clenched her fists, not making eye contact with anyone, despite the fact that everyone was currently staring at her. She couldn&rsquo;t even bring herself to answer Eliza. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rosalind, are you not feeling well?&rdquo; her brother Felix asked worriedly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c17">Stop it. </span><span class="c0">Rosalind shook her head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rosalind, if you&rsquo;re sick, you don&rsquo;t have to hide it,&rdquo; her brother Harold said, also worried.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c17">Please stop it!</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Rosalind&rsquo;s head sank. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rosalind, please answer us. We&rsquo;re worried about you,&rdquo; her father said, concerned. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind had had enough. She was tired of all of the concern, the worried looks, the pitiful words. She didn&rsquo;t want this, none of it! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once upon a time, it would have made her happy, but this was not that time. Things had changed far too much. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind stood from her chair, surprising everyone in the room. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip; I need some air,&rdquo; she whispered, her voice barely audible. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without waiting for a response, she turned on her heel and fled from the room, her heart racing and her mind spinning. She couldn&rsquo;t stay there, not surrounded by the people she had destroyed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She barely registered the familiar sights around&mdash;the polished marble floors, the ornate paintings, the soft rustle of curtains in the breeze. This didn&rsquo;t feel like the past. This was a prison of her own memories, of the time she had taken for granted once before. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finding herself in the garden, Rosalind collapsed onto a nearby bench, her body shaking violently with untold feelings. She buried her face in her hands, trying to calm her racing heart, but it was no use. The tears just wouldn&rsquo;t stop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She should have been thankful for this time, for the chance to be with her family again. But the sight of them broke her. It reminded her of the fact that she had destroyed this peace with her foolish actions. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind knew she had to do something. She couldn&rsquo;t bring upon the future again. And as it was her who caused all of it, it was only fair that she pay the price. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind had to lock herself away. </span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c22" id="h.8n6dvr2nzlaa"><span class="c18">Chapter 3 - Self-Imposed House Arrest</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For noble society, parties were considered the most dangerous battlefields of them all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How one performs at a party could affect their standing in the social sphere, in both good and bad ways. You never wanted to make a fool of yourself. That would destroy you, as no one would ever take you seriously again. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But an absence was more striking than any foolish actions. There were some parties you just couldn&rsquo;t miss. You wouldn&rsquo;t want to make enemies by turning certain families down. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody Astrale walked through the ballroom of her illustrious manor with practiced elegance. The walls shimmered with the glow of diamonds and crystals, while arches and centerpieces were coated in gold. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody herself was adorned with all kinds of shine. She wore diamond earrings, a blue dress lined with crystals, and her baby-blue hair was perfectly clean, to the extent that it sparkled every time she walked. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody loved all things beautiful and shiny. She adored rare crystals and gems the most, acting with any means necessary to increase her expensive collection. Of course, this made her the enemy of many people. Parties were tiring for her, because of this reason. She loved showing off her success, but she couldn&rsquo;t stand hearing the whispers of those who disliked her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But on this particular night, Melody felt free. For once in her life, she didn&rsquo;t hate the idea of attending parties. Why? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her biggest enemy wasn&rsquo;t present. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The whispers that spread throughout the crowd weren&rsquo;t about her. The gossip was on the one person who should have been there, who wouldn&rsquo;t miss an opportunity to make a fool of greedy Melody. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind Harcourt was not here. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For two weeks, the woman who had once commanded the attention of every room she entered had disappeared. A mystery had begun to spread throughout the country, growing from hushed whispers over tea to loud speculation in taverns. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wherever nobles gathered, and even amongst the commoners, one question dominated the conversation: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">Where had that terrible villainess gone?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind had always been the talk of parties, even when she wasn&rsquo;t present. After all, she was the perfect double-edged sword. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On one hand, she was the ideal noblewoman&mdash;refined, intelligent, and perfectly poised when she wished to be. Her beauty was well known throughout the kingdom, and her skill in navigating the noble scene made many envious. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But on the other hand, she was as unpredictable as a sudden storm. One moment, she would dazzle with her charm; the next, she would cut you down with a cruel remark or lash out over the smallest slight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The worst part was, no one could openly confront her. Not only was she the daughter of a powerful noble family, but she was also the consort to the crown prince. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Who would dare to stand against her?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But now, for the first time in years, Rosalind herself was not the center of discussion. Her absence had become far more interesting to talk about. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16">It was well known that Rosalind always attended any party she could, because that allowed her to flaunt her power. Sure, she didn&rsquo;t go to </span><span class="c16 c17">every</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;party, but the trick was that you could never predict where she would show up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet, in this case, she wasn&rsquo;t making any appearances. Rumors had begun to spread. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The nobles whispered among themselves, exchanging wild stories about why she had locked herself away. Some said she had fallen ill, others believed she had died in secret.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16">A few even whispered that she was being punished&mdash;had she committed some sort of terrible crime? Rosalind </span><span class="c16 c17">was </span><span class="c0">a villainess, so it was no surprise to think she may have done something wrong. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But she had done so many other things practically in broad daylight and gotten away with it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her servants knew the kind of terrible schemes she hatched against noblewomen and noblemen who simply got on her nerves. Why would she hide away only now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody, standing among her circle of friends, allowed herself a satisfied smile as she overheard the latest round of rumors circulating the room. It wasn&rsquo;t often that she could enjoy herself at one of these parties without having to worry about Rosalind&rsquo;s sharp tongue or calculating gaze. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tonight, for the first time in what felt like ages, Melody could bask in the attention without fear of being upstaged by her greatest rival.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lady Melody,&rdquo; one of her companions, a fellow noblewoman named Lady Vella, chuckled lightly. &ldquo;You seem unusually cheerful tonight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody lips curved into a smug smile. &ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t I be? That detestable villainess isn&rsquo;t here to spoil my mood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The women around her shared knowing glances. Rosalind&rsquo;s absence had been a topic of speculation for days, and every new theory seemed wilder than the last. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where do you think she is?&rdquo; Lady Vella asked, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. &ldquo;Her absence is certainly&hellip; unnerving, to say the least.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I heard,&rdquo; another noblewoman, Lady Yunee, interjected, &ldquo;that she&rsquo;s locked herself away in her estate. My handmaiden is friends with one of her maids, and she said Rosalind has refused to leave her room for weeks. She even sent out a message&mdash;something about &lsquo;house arrest.&rsquo; What do you think that means?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody&rsquo;s smile widened. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it obvious? The prince has finally tired of her antics and given her the punishment she deserves.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gasps followed, the suggestion carrying weight among the gossip-hungry crowd. &quot;The prince?&quot; Lady Vella leaned in, her voice barely a whisper. &quot;What makes you believe that?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, why else would such a deplorable woman disappear from the spotlight? Clearly she became enemies with the wrong person. Definitely deserved, I say.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The noblewomen nodded in eager agreement. Lady Rosalind had always been a thorn in their collective sides, a looming presence who thrived on intimidation. But now, with her mysterious absence, they felt confident in speaking their grievances.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;She was always targeting you, wasn&rsquo;t she?&quot; Lady Vella&rsquo;s voice held a trace of sympathy, but her eyes sparkled with curiosity. &quot;This must feel incredibly liberating.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Liberating,&quot; Melody echoed, the word rolling off her tongue. &quot;Yes, I suppose that&rsquo;s exactly how it feels.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Understandable. Though I do wonder,&quot; Lady Yunee started cautiously, &quot;what exactly did you do to earn Lady Rosalind&rsquo;s ire?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody thought for a moment and then chuckled again. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just say&hellip; there was something she possessed that I wanted, and she didn&rsquo;t particularly like my methods of procuring it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;My, how petty of her,&quot; Lady Vella remarked, raising an eyebrow. &quot;She despises you over such a trivial matter?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody shook her head. &ldquo;Well, you never know with villainesses. Sometimes they antagonize you for the sake of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The group laughed, but there was an edge of unease beneath their amusement. As much as they delighted in tearing Rosalind down behind her back, the fear of her return made them hesitate. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What if, one day, she returned with a deep vengeance? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the conversation continued, Duke Hartwen, an older nobleman with a sharp gaze and a clean-cut appearance, approached the group. His arrival immediately commanded attention. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lady Melody,&rdquo; he greeted her with a respectful nod, &ldquo;Once again you&rsquo;ve outdone yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Duke Hartwen, it&rsquo;s always a pleasure to see you at my parties,&rdquo; Melody replied smoothly, offering her hand for a courteous shake. &ldquo;Is there something you wish to discuss? I trust everything is to your liking?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course, of course. I just happened to overhear your conversation. I presume you all were discussing the &lsquo;missing villainess&rsquo; and the rumors surrounding her?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Indeed. Her disappearance has caused much confusion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Duke Hartwen nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; he mused, swirling his glass of wine thoughtfully. &ldquo;Her parents don&rsquo;t seem to know anything either. You&rsquo;d think they&rsquo;d be involved somehow, but they are just as confused as we are.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody pondered. &ldquo;Well&hellip; we&rsquo;ve all heard the whispers, haven&rsquo;t we? Apparently, she hasn&rsquo;t requested any visitors. Not her parents, not even the prince. And she hasn&rsquo;t demanded her usual luxuries.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Duke Hartwen raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;No visitors? None at all? That&rsquo;s unusual. Lady Rosalind thrives on attention.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Melody agreed. &ldquo;Which is why something doesn&rsquo;t add up. If she were ill, surely the court physicians would have been summoned. And if she were being punished, the rumors would have reached us by now. But it&rsquo;s all quiet. Too quiet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Duke Hartwen sipped his wine, his mind churning. &ldquo;Whatever the reason, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before she returns. And when she does, I&rsquo;m sure she will never hear the end of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody crossed her arms, her jaw tightening. &ldquo;I think it would be better if she never returned at all.&rdquo;</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bethany knocked gently on the heavy oak door of Rosalind&rsquo;s bedroom. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;My lady, I&rsquo;ve brought you some food.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no response. Bethany waited a moment longer, her frown deepening as the silence stretched on. It had been days since Rosalind had willingly spoken to anyone, and even longer since she&rsquo;d emerged from her room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My lady&hellip;&rdquo; Bethany&#39;s voice softened with concern as she tried again, but there was still no reply. With a resigned sigh, she placed the tray of food gently on the floor, careful not to make too much noise, and turned to leave.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Bethany&rsquo;s footsteps faded down the corridor, slowly the door opened. Rosalind peeked out only to grab her food and then closed it once again, locking it tightly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She walked slowly across the dimly lit room, her bare feet brushing over the cold floor. She made her way to the wide window that overlooked the estate&#39;s gardens. Once upon a time, she would look out this window with a sense of pride, but now she only felt crushing pain seeing her estate. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She had lost this place once before, because of her failures. And she had many, many failures. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind sat down on the floor and rested against the window, taking small bites of her food. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now, she looked like a ghost. Her skin was pale, her entire form was thin, and she had large bags under her eyes. It was like she was back in that old dirty prison cell again. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Except, this prison was one of her own making. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind simply couldn&rsquo;t sleep. She kept having nightmares of the past, in which the consequences of her actions played out before her on repeat. Every morning, she would wake up trembling and drenched in sweat. Desperately, she would wipe her hands on the bed sheets, as if cleaning off blood that wasn&rsquo;t there. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The skin on her hands had grown red and bruised from the constant rubbing, but no amount of scrubbing could erase her sins. Guilt was overtaking her to no end. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">More than once, Rosalind had stood at the edge of her window, staring down at the concrete below, her mind tempted by the thought of ending it all. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But death still scared her, even now. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, it wasn&rsquo;t because she felt an obligation to apologize or repent, though that was part of the reason. It was because she was afraid. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind placed her half-eaten food aside and lay down on the floor, her body curling into the fetal position as she gazed blankly out the window.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I want to forget&hellip; let me forget&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She muttered, her voice soft and weak. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But for as long as she lived, Rosalind would never forget the day she lost everything. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was impossible. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How could she escape this neverending house arrest? It was a punishment of her own making, but one that nearly destroyed her. It gave her too much time to think about everything. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And she certainly did think. Every single day she spent in solitude, she recounted every single day of the past before she went back in time. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She had practically broken herself. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After all, what harder prison is there to escape than one&rsquo;s own mind?</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c15" id="h.7yqn9tbiczll"><span class="c21 c24">Interlude 2 - The Man In The Glass (</span><span class="c21 c37">Peter Dale Wimbrow Sr.</span><span class="c21 c24">)</span></h3><p class="c12"><span class="c0">When you get what you want in your struggle for self<br>And the world makes you king for a day<br>Just go to the mirror and look at yourself<br>And see what that man has to say.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">For it isn&rsquo;t your father, or mother, or wife<br>Whose judgment upon you must pass<br>The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life<br>Is the one staring back from the glass.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s the fellow to please &ndash; never mind all the rest<br>For he&rsquo;s with you, clear to the end<br>And you&rsquo;ve passed your most difficult, dangerous test<br>If the man in the glass is your friend.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years<br>And get pats on the back as you pass<br>But your final reward will be heartache and tears<br>If you&rsquo;ve cheated the man in the glass.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c22" id="h.9gqy43wk3bg7"><span class="c18">Chapter 4 - Nightmares In The Greenhouse</span></h2><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Evening rain battered against the windows of Rosalind&rsquo;s bedroom. The sharp patter was a familiar sound by now; it was if the sky itself was following her solemnity. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">It was the fourth night in a row she couldn&rsquo;t sleep. Or was it the fifth? Rosalind had lost track of the sleepless nights, the anxiety-filled hours spent lying awake as terrible memories, guilt-ridden feelings, and sadness clawed at her mind. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Sleep was no better. Everytime she closed her eyes, she found herself transported back to that prison cell, watching everyone she loved suffer and die, waiting for her own inevitable end. She remembered the damp air, the awful smell of blood, and the cold metal shackles that bound her wrists. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Living with guilt was miserable, but it was far better than reliving that nightmare.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Hearing the shutters rattle, Rosalind opened her window. A cold gust and rain struck her face, but she didn&rsquo;t flinch at the elements. Her gaze drifted to the dark horizon, where a small glass structure lay distant, but visible. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">A look of recognition filled her eyes, and before she knew it, she&rsquo;d thrown on her cloak and slipped quietly through the silent halls of the manor. This was a spur of the moment decision, but one that Rosalind desired. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">She had been in her room, engrossed in her turbulent thoughts, and held the guilt of her past, for far too long. She still felt somewhat guilty, though; clearly everyone was worried about her, even the servants were wondering if something had happened. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">She knew she couldn&rsquo;t let this go on. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">But part of her was thankful for this long period of solitude. Without it, she probably wouldn&rsquo;t be thinking about all of these things. She would have never realized how much she missed out on. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">The rain slowed to a light drizzle as Rosalind stepped outside into the night air. Storm clouds still dotted the sky, leaving the world in a palpable darkness, darker than even the night sky could provide. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Rosalind pulled her cloak tighter around herself. Right now, she looked miserable, like a vagrant or a hermit. Her clothes were becoming dirtier, but she was no stranger to it. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">It was wonderful to even have comfortable clothes at all, when she considered the conditions of the prison cell she was once confined to.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">The long troughs of her family&rsquo;s extensive gardens came into view as she walked along the dark pathways. This late at night, everywhere felt like a maze to traverse. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Eventually, the faint outline of a glass building grew clearer and clearer as she approached. It had been many years since Rosalind visited the greenhouse that lay on the Harcourt manor grounds. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">She was just a little girl at that time, an innocent dove that knew nothing of the world she was growing up in. She simply loved to play with her friends and wanted nothing more than to care for the lavender in her greenhouse. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">But the truth of life is more complex than that. Far more complex. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Rosalind felt a heavy sense of guilt as she observed the greenhouse&rsquo;s condition. It had been built for her, a present to celebrate her birth, but once she became an adult, she paid it no mind.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">There wasn&rsquo;t time for flowers and lavender, she reasoned, as she had to become an adult worthy of her family name. She had to become someone the prince would love.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Love&hellip;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Rosalind cursed the word love. At least, the love for another, the feeling of desire and lust. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">No, she preferred childhood love, when she could love anything, anyone, when the things she loved most were the lavender petals of flowers.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Rosalind grasped an aging handle and pushed open the greenhouse door, which resisted under the tangle of vines that now claimed it. A blast of earthly air greeted her, filling her with a sense of nostalgia. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while,&rdquo; she muttered with a small smile.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">As she gingerly traveled the familiar paths between the plant beds, she experienced bursts of recognition at various sights. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">She remembered the rare species, the vines and exotic roots that had been sourced from far away places. Most of all she remembered her lavender, which was still preserved as it had been so many years ago. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">She ran her hands through the familiar purple petals and smiled. These flowers had been her closest friends, she had confided many childish whims to them. But now those were all in the past. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Rosalind sighed. How many times had she experienced this overwhelming sadness? </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">She stared at her reflection in one of the glass windows. In the dim light, her reflection looked pale and ghostly. Her once strong gaze was now dull and lifeless. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">The sight ate at her pride. Rosalind had always tried so hard to appear strong and confident. She never wanted to show weakness, because weakness was the biggest weapon of a noble. She knew the only way she could live up to her family name was by erasing all signs of weakness. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">This greenhouse was one of the casualties. She had chosen to forget its existence because it was a weakness. A strong family heir shouldn&rsquo;t concern themselves with flowers. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">But now, standing there in the middle of this place she once loved, she hated herself for doing that. How could she allow it to fall into such disarray? </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Rosalind reached out and touched the dirty glass. A chill ran down her spine as she stared at her reflection, her other self seeming to look back with cold, heartless judgment. She could almost hear words of mocking, echoes of her own condemnation. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c11">You don&rsquo;t deserve this second chance. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c11">You&rsquo;ll only hurt them again.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c11">You&rsquo;re a monster, Rosalind.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c11">Who would ever forgive you?</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">She squeezed her eyes shut, trying to drown the voices out as they grew louder. The guilt was suffocating, pressing down on her like an unmovable weight. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she whispered, her voice trembling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not that person anymore. I can repent for my sins.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">But the words sounded unbelievable, even to her own ears. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Rosalind stared up at the glass ceiling of the greenhouse and sighed. As the rain trickled down outside, she felt so hopeless.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c16">At this point, she would take anything, </span><span class="c16 c17">anything</span><span class="c0">, to rid herself of the awful past that just wouldn&rsquo;t leave her alone.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">A sudden creak from the greenhouse door pulled her from her thoughts. Rosalind froze, her eyes snapping open. In the doorway stood a figure, her form encased in shadow, but unmistakable. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eliza&hellip;?&rdquo; Rosalind whispered, her voice barely a breath. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">The girl took a step forward, her face hidden, obscured, but her eyes&hellip; her eyes held a gaze that seemed to pierce directly into Rosalind&rsquo;s soul. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You let me die, Rose.&rdquo; Eliza&rsquo;s voice was soft, yet forceful enough to send shivers down her spine.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Rosalind stumbled back, a hoarse gasp escaping her lips. &ldquo;N-no&hellip; I&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t mean to&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I always looked up to you,&rdquo; Eliza ignored her pleas, her voice icy with accusation. &ldquo;But in the end, you really are a villainess. I never wanted to believe it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Rosalind shook her head, holding her hands against her ears as if she could block out the poisonous words.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No&hellip; stop it!&rdquo; she cried, her voice trembling. &ldquo;I tried to protect you! I never wanted you to suffer because of me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Eliza mechanically tilted her head. &ldquo;Then why did you let it happen?&rdquo; she hissed, taking a step closer. &ldquo;When I begged for them to stop, did you listen, Rose? Did you protect me? Or did you give up when we all needed you the most?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s vision blurred with tears. Memories of that terrible day flashed before her, the blood, the cries, the desperate pleas. She fell to her knees and whimpered. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; she whispered, the words barely audible. &ldquo;No more&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is your eternal punishment, Rose.&rdquo; Every bit of Eliza&rsquo;s words struck her. &ldquo;You should suffer for everything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eliza&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind choked, her gaze filled with unknowable despair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I am so, so sorry&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">The figure inched closer, a twisted smile spreading across her face. She pulled Rosalind into a hug, and for a second, she had a foolish hope that Eliza would forgive her. But instead she leaned into Rosalind&rsquo;s ear and whispered: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forgive you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Rosalind shook in the cold, uncaring embrace. She tried to push Eliza away, but Eliza wasn&rsquo;t letting her go. &ldquo;No&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Shadows spilled from Eliza&rsquo;s form, overtaking Rosalind with an impenetrable darkness. &ldquo;I hate you,&rdquo; came Eliza&rsquo;s final whisper, a vow that echoed in the void. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">In that darkness, hearing those awful words from the sister she loved so much, Rosalind couldn&rsquo;t help but yell out: &ldquo;STOP IT!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">The air went silent and the darkness faded. She realized she hadn&rsquo;t moved from where she was standing once before. And the greenhouse door was still closed. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Eliza wasn&rsquo;t there. Of course she wasn&rsquo;t, it was too late for her to be awake.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">It was simply a manifestation of her own inner hatred.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Eliza would never think those things. She would never say those things. Eliza had loved her, trusted her, depended on her. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">But Rosalind had been telling herself these things all along. And she had broken that love and trust when her little sister needed it the most. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">She couldn&rsquo;t let this go on. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">How long would the torment continue if she allowed it? </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s heart ached as she stood in the palpable silence. She had been given this second chance, this opportunity to rewrite her mistakes. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">But could she prevent herself from repeating those past actions? What if she led everyone to ruin in another way? What if it was all futile? </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Then a distant memory surfaced: &ldquo;Rose!&rdquo; Eliza&rsquo;s warm voice, her cheerful laughter, and her wonderful smile. It was only a memory. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">But Rosalind had a realization. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">She didn&rsquo;t know whether it was possible to truly repent for everything she had done. But regardless of that fact, she owed it to her little sister to make amends. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">If she could only retain that smile, that lovely little bit of affection that kept her from going over the edge so many times in the past. That smile which she turned away out of fear of weakness. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">But not only that, she owed it to everyone who suffered for her mistakes in her first life. She had to make it up to her parents, the servants, to Bethany, who served her so dutifully&hellip;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Rosalind looked around the greenhouse, her gaze settling on the lavender. She picked a small bundle, clutching the flowers like a lifeline. Then she turned and stepped out into the fresh air. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">The storm had passed, and the clouds had parted, revealing a clear, starlit sky. She took a deep breath and allowed the cool night to engulf her. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">She couldn&rsquo;t let this go on. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Rosalind had whispered those words to herself enough times, and now, it was truly time to end the charade of &lsquo;house arrest.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">She didn&rsquo;t want to face judgment&mdash;not again. But deep down, she also knew that judgment hurt far more when faced alone.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">Rosalind had only one choice. If she wanted to defeat her inner judgment, all she had to do was replace it with repentance. Endless, painful, unrelenting repentance. </span></p><h2 class="c22" id="h.kwd5spzar6ff"><span class="c21">Chapter 5 - First Steps Of Repentance</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the early morning, Eliza approached Rosalind&rsquo;s door. It had been a while since she had seen any sign of her older sister. Rosalind had withdrawn so completely into her solitude, that Eliza wondered if something happened to her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Standing there, she was tempted to knock, but she knew Rosalind wanted to be alone. She had turned everyone else away, why would this time be any different? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eliza had never seen this side of her sister before. Rosalind had always been such an untouchable figure, poised and perfect, someone she looked up to. And yet, Eliza sensed that her sister had become fragile, solemn, and resigned. It honestly scared her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As she turned to leave, she heard the door creak softly. Rosalind stood there, still dressed in her night clothes, her face pale but calm. Her expression was sadder than Eliza had ever seen, and her eyes held an unfamiliar warmth. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rose?&rdquo; Eliza whispered, not daring to believe this was truly her proud sister. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind smiled&mdash;a small, genuine smile that made her heart leap. &ldquo;Good morning, Eliza.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her voice was full of warmth and gentleness&mdash;it was the same voice Eliza remembered from her childhood, when her older sister would read her bedtime stories. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are&hellip; are you still sad?&rdquo; Eliza asked, hesitant and uncertain. She&rsquo;d never known how to talk with Rosalind as she got older and more refined. It always seemed like her sister was far out of reach. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A faint shadow passed over Rosalind&rsquo;s face as her gaze shifted momentarily to the floor. &ldquo;A little,&rdquo; she admitted quietly. &ldquo;But now I have work to do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Work?&rdquo; Eliza asked curiously, tilting her head. Was she going to lose her sister again? After showing this genuine side to herself, was she really going to go back to being stoic and cold? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before Eliza could respond, Rosalind leaned in and pulled her into a warm, almost desperate embrace. Her eyes went wide. It had been years since her sister hugged her like this, her touch full of love and affection. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As my dearest little sister, I love you, Eliza. And I&rsquo;m sorry for not admitting this sooner,&rdquo; Rosalind whispered.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Eliza&rsquo;s eyes widened as she returned the embrace, her mind reeling. Her sister had always been so distant, never showing affection at any moment. She simply didn&rsquo;t know what to make of this soft, earnest side of Rosalind.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">A thousand questions filled her mind, but only one spilled out. &ldquo;What&hellip; happened?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Rosalind gave a small, sad smile as she pulled back. &ldquo;I just&hellip; realized a lot of things,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;And now I want to make things right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Her words were strange and mysterious, but Eliza found herself nodding. Rosalind had clearly changed&mdash;there was no denying it. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now, can you fetch Bethany for me? I have something to tell her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eliza nodded silently, trying to mask her confusion as she hurried off down the hall to find Bethany. She had no idea what happened to her sister, nor did she really understand her actions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What could affect such a strong person to this extent? </span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Rosalind watched her little sister leave the room, her heart swelling with bittersweet emotion. Settling into a nearby chair, she took a steadying breath. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She knew her actions might have seemed strange to Eliza, who had known her as guarded and cold. But Rosalind couldn&rsquo;t go back to being that person, not now, not ever. Her former life had told her what consequences would follow if she allowed herself to fall again. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The memory of that vision in the greenhouse&mdash;a nightmare, yet so vivid it felt real&mdash;still lingered in her mind. Every bitter word and hurtful accusation seared her soul, leaving mental wounds that she couldn&rsquo;t erase. She still heard the terrible words that hurt her the most. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c17">You&rsquo;re just a villainess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The words tore at her, a relentless reminder of who she had once been, the mistakes she had made, the lives she had ruined. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind was scared. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But she couldn&rsquo;t let herself fall to that fear. At the very least, she had to overcome it for the sake of those she hurt, so she could apologize to them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her thoughts were interrupted by a soft knock. Turning, she saw Bethany, her handmaid, standing in the doorway. Bethany&rsquo;s face held a mixture of surprise and worry as she took in Rosalind&rsquo;s weary expression and her disheveled attire. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You called for me, my lady?&rdquo; Bethany asked, her tone respectful but tinged with unease. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, Bethany,&rdquo; Rosalind said, her heart pounding nervously. She motioned to the chair next to her. &ldquo;Sit with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bethany did as she was told, but her gaze lingered on a small vase of lavender flowers arranged on the nearby side table, presumably from the previous night. They had been perfectly watered and cared for. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">How long had it been since she saw those flowers being displayed so openly? She was under the impression that Rosalind had become ashamed of her gardening past, but now this?</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My lady?&rdquo; Bethany asked, her eyes shifting back to Rosalind, whose gaze softened.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, I noticed you looking at those,&rdquo; Rosalind said, her voice quiet. She picked up the vase and looked at the flowers with a faint smile. &ldquo;I was foolish to give this up,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;How could I have forgotten my own roots?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Bethany&rsquo;s eyes widened. The gentle way Rosalind held the flowers struck her as a new side to her mistress&mdash;one she hadn&rsquo;t seen in quite some time.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Rosalind turned to Bethany. &ldquo;So Bethany, I would like you to start fetching me some lavender every day for my room. Is that okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course, my lady.&rdquo; Bethany said with a smile. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Rosalind observed her for a few moments, then looked down, her expression clouding with unease. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else I wanted to tell you&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered nervously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard for me to say.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Bethany waited, surprised by the rare vulnerability in Rosalind&rsquo;s tone. &ldquo;Go ahead, my lady. I&rsquo;m listening.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bethany, I&hellip; I want to apologize to you.&rdquo; Rosalind began, her voice quiet. &ldquo;For everything I&rsquo;ve done. For all the times I&rsquo;ve used you. Serving my selfishness was truly a fate you didn&rsquo;t deserve.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c16">Bethany was left speechless. Rosalind was apologizing to </span><span class="c16 c17">her</span><span class="c0">? The one who always asked her to do nearly impossible things and get her hands dirty for evil schemes? </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Surely this couldn&rsquo;t be real?</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I understand if you find it hard to forgive me,&rdquo; Rosalind continued sadly. &ldquo;I would feel the same way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">A long silence settled between them, and for a moment, Rosalind feared Bethany wouldn&rsquo;t believe her. But to her surprise, Bethany&rsquo;s face softened with emotion.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My lady,&rdquo; she whispered, her voice soft. &ldquo;I&hellip; I never expected to hear those words from you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s own eyes stung as she gave a small, trembling smile. &ldquo;Then I suppose it&rsquo;s about time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Bethany nodded, her expression one of tentative hope. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re truly set on making amends, my lady, then I will gladly stand by your side.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Rosalind eyed her in surprise, she could feel her hands shaking, in fact they had been shaking the entire time. This was too fast, something about her acceptance was almost&hellip; scary. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bethany&hellip;&rdquo; she started, her voice shaking. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to lie to me. If you&rsquo;re upset with what I&rsquo;ve done and want to leave, you can tell me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Bethany placed a hand on Rosalind&rsquo;s own, and smiled. &ldquo;I live to serve you, my lady. There have been times when I&rsquo;ve felt apprehensive, but I would never choose to leave your side. I would take your hand even if you told me not to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c16">Rosalind frowned. </span><span class="c16 c17">I know you would. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m scared of.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">She knew Bethany wasn&rsquo;t lying. She had seen it first hand, when everything had ended, and everyone lost their lives because of her. Bethany had truly been with her to the very end. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Rosalind steadied herself. She didn&rsquo;t want tears to start falling. &ldquo;I want to talk with all of the servants,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;Can you help me apologize to them?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Bethany smiled. &ldquo;I would love nothing more, my lady.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">With that, Rosalind&rsquo;s first true steps towards repentance began. The servants were the first to see just how determined she was to apologize and make amends. She apologized and spoke to everyone&mdash;the maids, cooks, butlers, stable hands, and even the groundskeepers.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Through each of them, she learned of their problems, and one by one she tried to help them out. She even helped the gardeners tend to the grounds, and assisted in the kitchen once or twice. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Those with sick loved ones or serious illnesses were given expensive medicine, extra meals were sent home with those struggling, and some were given well-deserved time off. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Her efforts were paying off little by little, until everyone on the estate was whispering about the new Rosalind, and how she had changed for the better. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">But Rosalind couldn&rsquo;t avoid the public eye for too much longer. An event she dreaded was going to begin soon, and it was mandatory for all nobles (if you didn&rsquo;t want to be ridiculed). </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">One afternoon, as Rosalind collapsed into a chair, thoroughly exhausted from assisting in the kitchens, Bethany entered the room, holding an ornate envelope. As soon as she saw it, Rosalind groaned. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My lady, you&rsquo;ve received an invitation,&rdquo; Bethany announced, handing her the envelope. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Rosalind took it with a weary sigh and groaned again when she saw where it was from. &ldquo;So Prince Vicente&rsquo;s birthday party is approaching&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I heard it&rsquo;s going to be quite grand,&rdquo; Bethany said, nodding. &ldquo;Shall we begin preparing dresses?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Rosalind hated it, but she reluctantly nodded. &ldquo;Yes, unfortunately.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Bethany chuckled. &ldquo;My lady, you&rsquo;ve become so honest lately. I prefer this side of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Rosalind smiled. &ldquo;So do I.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">As they looked at the dresses in Rosalind&rsquo;s closet, Rosalind thought about her plans for the upcoming party. As much as she really didn&rsquo;t want to go, she also knew this was the perfect opportunity to make amends with the prince. Most importantly, she would also be able to talk with Marciella and apologize to her. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Slowly but surely, Rosalind would begin to heal the wounds she had created in the wake of her foolishness. And honestly, she was looking forward to it.</span></p><p class="c14 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c14 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c15" id="h.obw5hvvljnu8"><span class="c18">Interlude 3 - Apology (original poem)</span></h3><p class="c12 c27"><span class="c0">An apology is like a double-edged sword. </span></p><p class="c12 c27"><span class="c0">The one making it amends.</span></p><p class="c12 c27"><span class="c0">The one receiving it forgives.</span></p><p class="c12 c27"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c12 c27"><span class="c0">But how do you choose forgiveness?</span></p><p class="c12 c27"><span class="c0">Can a sinner be forgiven for sin?</span></p><p class="c12 c27"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c12 c27"><span class="c0">What, then, makes them a sinner,</span></p><p class="c12 c27"><span class="c0">If their sin no longer exists?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c22" id="h.juww5npqtw2i"><span class="c18">Chapter 6 - Breaking An Unrequited Love (Part One)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The day Rosalind dreaded the most. Prince Vicente&rsquo;s birthday party was set to begin on this night. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind sat patiently as her styling maids decorated her. They had always been experts at this, even in the past, but she had never taken the time to thank them. In fact, she never even considered them. What a mistake. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of the maids presented her with a wooden box filled with an assortment of beautiful necklaces, their gemstones sparkling under the room&rsquo;s soft candlelight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Which of these would you like to wear, my lady?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind gave the pieces a cursory glance and then smiled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What about this one?&rdquo; she suggested, holding up a simple chain necklace that contained a single small crystal in the middle. It was a far cry from the lavish things she usually wore. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The maids exchanged glances, their surprise apparent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you certain, my lady?&rdquo; one of them asked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite simple compared to what you usually wear.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Rosalind nodded. &ldquo;I want to go for a simple look tonight. That&rsquo;s why I chose this reserved dress, after all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The maids looked at each other, then back at Rosalind, and shrugged. &ldquo;As you say, my lady.&rdquo; One of them pointed to the bracelet on Rosalind&rsquo;s wrist, a piece she had long forgotten, but wore proudly as a reminder of her past life, where it all ended. &ldquo;And your bracelet, my lady? Will you keep it on?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Rosalind ran her fingers over its aging band, smiling fondly. &ldquo;It is important to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The maids nodded and began their work. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They worked their magic, using the simple pieces to transform Rosalind into a beauty. Even a reserved attire looked nice on her. For the first time, she felt like she was presenting herself as she truly was, without the need for pretense or show.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When they finally finished, they allowed her to look in the mirror. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you think, my lady?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind observed her reflection. Her dress was perfectly subtle and her use of jewelry was excellently minimal. Her hair had also been expertly styled. She smiled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I look perfect,&rdquo; she said genuinely. &ldquo;Thank you both for always doing your absolute best.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The maids were in disbelief at her words of appreciation. They had never heard her say such things before, but they could tell by the look in Rosalind&rsquo;s face that she was being honest. Their expressions warmed in response. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you, my lady,&rdquo; they both said, curtsying with shy smiles. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Rosalind stood to leave, she took one last look and steeled herself. She felt different, not only in appearance, but in her emotions as well. She was going into the battlefield with a lot of preparation, but the outcome truly lay in her actions. She had to make this a night of change and proper amends. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind left the room and walked along the halls of the manor. Her family was all there in the foyer, waiting for her presence. She smiled upon seeing her little sister Eliza in a cute flower dress, and descended the stairs, pulling her into a loving hug. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You look so cute, Eliza,&rdquo; Rosalind said happily. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eliza was caught off-guard by the sudden affection, but melted into the feeling with a gleeful smile. &ldquo;And you look beautiful, Rose!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As everyone became aware of her presence, gasps echoed through the room, everyone&rsquo;s eyes widening at the sight of her. Her father looked at her with both surprise and approval, while her mother&rsquo;s brows furrowed at the subtlety she displayed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rosalind&hellip; your appearance is so&hellip; understated,&rdquo; one of her brothers said, breaking the silence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s still beautiful despite that!&rdquo; Eliza snapped back with a pout.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course she is,&rdquo; her father said, &ldquo;But why so reserved, Rosalind?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind offered a small smile, shrugging lightly. &ldquo;I thought it was time for a change.&rdquo;</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Entering the Harcourt family!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">The doors to the castle ballroom opened grandly, as whispers filled the air at Rosalind&rsquo;s presence. It had been a while since anyone saw her. But here she was, and&hellip; she seemed different?</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Rosalind had always been known for her lavish dresses, but today she was dressed in the most subtle way anyone had ever seen her. On top of that, she carried a calm, almost demure cadence. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Is that really Lady Rosalind?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c11">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s so muted today. Do you think she&rsquo;s ill?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Look at how close she is with her little sister. Have you ever seen her showing such affection before?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c11">&ldquo;What evil scheme is she planning this time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Normally, Rosalind would respond to these whispers with strong glares, but today she ignored them completely. She turned to Eliza who was standing by her side. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eliza, go with mother and father. You&rsquo;ll be safer with them,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Mother, that&#39;s okay with you, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, of course it is,&rdquo; her mother responded with a nod. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But I want to stay with you,&rdquo; Eliza whined. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Eliza,&rdquo; Rosalind said sadly. &ldquo;But there are too many bad actors here. I don&rsquo;t want you to be involved with them.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Eliza frowned. &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take care of you, Eliza,&rdquo; Rosalind&rsquo;s mother said with a smile. &ldquo;And I appreciate you looking out for her, Rosalind.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Rosalind smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my duty as her older sister.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">She watched as her family walked away and sighed, wishing she could talk with Eliza more. But she knew this was not a good place for a little girl to be a witness. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, well, well,&rdquo; said a voice from behind her that she recognized as Melody&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Look who&rsquo;s finally returned.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Melody,&rdquo; Rosalind bowed. Melody didn&rsquo;t expect that. &ldquo;I trust you&rsquo;ve been well? A lot has happened between us, but I hope we can be amicable from this point onward.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Before Melody could respond, Rosalind placed a single lavender flower in her hair. She then walked away. Part of her also wanted to talk with Melody more, to rekindle their friendship, but that would have to wait. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">First she had to turn her attention to the prince. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Rosalind went to a nearby table and grabbed a glass of wine. She downed the entire thing, as the doors to the ballroom opened.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Entering Prince Vicente and Lady Marciella Watrese!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">The entire room tensed up as the two entered. Rosalind watched them intently, waiting for an opportune moment. Seeing those two together, she couldn&rsquo;t help the jealous feelings in her heart. But she knew it was futile to break them up. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">After all, the consequences of that action were plenty clear to her. So, as they passed by her, rather than anger, Rosalind simply bowed respectfully. It was clearly a surprising gesture, if the loud whispers were anything to go by. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">For several long minutes, Rosalind only watched the prince and Marciella interact with other party guests. She didn&rsquo;t know what feelings she was staring with. Perhaps she was simply letting resignation overtake her, so she could finally move on. Or maybe she still felt a sliver of affection for Prince Vicente. Whatever it was&mdash;sadness, resignation, anger&mdash;Rosalind didn&rsquo;t say a single word. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Of course, it wouldn&rsquo;t be long before people approached her in an attempt to change that. A malicious group of noblewomen walked up to her from behind. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lady Rosalind, you&rsquo;ve returned to high society,&rdquo; said their leader, sneering, &ldquo;I suppose that long absence cleansed your mind of foolishness?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">A vein nearly popped in Rosalind&rsquo;s head, but she controlled herself. She knew that if she wanted to convince everyone of her intent to change, she couldn&rsquo;t keep retorting to those who provoked her. After all, these people only now had the confidence to criticize her because they presumed she had faced a punishment that humbled her. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">To be fair, were they really wrong? Being in solitude for that long did allow her to think about her mistakes. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re absolutely correct, Lady Jeau,&rdquo; Rosalind nodded thoughtfully. &ldquo;I have been pretty foolish. If I hurt you in any way, I apologize.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">The other women exchanged confused glances, clearly taken aback by her response. Was this really the villainess Rosalind? They expected some fiery retort or snide remark, but this&hellip; she actually offered an apology?</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lady Rosalind, do you really mean that?&rdquo; one of the noblewomen asked, her eyes full of doubt. &ldquo;Or are you scheming something?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course I mean it,&rdquo; Rosalind said genuinely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to cause any disturbances. I&rsquo;m just enjoying my own company.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Really? Surely you must feel some bitterness?&rdquo; said Lady Jeau, attempting to provoke her once again. &ldquo;After all, Prince Vincente is getting engaged to Lady Marciella instead of you, his fiance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Rosalind&#39;s gaze softened as she looked towards Vicente and Marciella. &ldquo;I was upset once, furious even. But now I just want them to be happy. There never was any place for me.&rdquo; </span></p><hr><p class="c14 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">As the party continued into the night, Rosalind tried her hardest to reach Prince Vicente. She waited patiently for any opportunity, hoping he would be alone, preferably not near anyone who would immediately start gossiping. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">But there was just one problem. Every time Rosalind tried to approach him, something or someone got in the way. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">First, a famous duke appeared from nowhere, launching into an animated discussion with the prince about trade and politics. Rosalind lingered, hoping the conversation would end, but it seemed like it never would. And just when she was beginning to fall asleep listening to them talk, it was over. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">But as soon as it ended, an eager noblewoman approached him from thin air to try to get his attention with flattery and feigned kindness. Her conversation with him never seemed to end either. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Worst still, even Rosalind&rsquo;s own nerves were working against her. A rare free moment would seem like a daunting task, and then she was back to square one. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c16">In the end, Rosalind was left with no progress on her attempts to apologize. She never thought it would be so difficult to simply say &lsquo;sorry.&rsquo; And she really, </span><span class="c16 c17">really</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;wanted to. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Standing outside on a secluded balcony, Rosalind took a sip of wine and sighed. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">She stared up at the night stars, pondering her next move. There were many people she needed to address, and just as many turbulent thoughts moving through her head. But for just a few minutes, she let herself breathe, her fingers absently playing with the bracelet on her wrist. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">At that moment, the door opened, breaking Rosalind from her thoughts. She turned to see Melody standing there, her expression conflicted. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rosalind&hellip;&rdquo; she started hesitantly. &ldquo;Did you really mean what you said back there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Rosalind smiled sadly, looking to the ground. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it matters what I say,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to you to decide whether you believe me. Not that anything I&rsquo;ve done is worth forgiving.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; Melody gritted her teeth. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. You&rsquo;ve been attacking me all this time, but now you choose to apologize? How am I supposed to believe that any of this is genuine?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Rosalind said nothing, only rolling up the sleeves of her dress to show a series of small scars. Melody gasped at what she saw, her hand flying to her mouth.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is just a small part of it,&rdquo; Rosalind whispered, her voice almost incomprehensible in the night air.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Melody&rsquo;s voice shook as she whispered, &ldquo;What&hellip;? You really&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rosalind nodded. &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;m a very hypocritical person. I do things to protect my honor, that I consider necessary, but in secret I loathe myself. You think I enjoyed throwing insults? It wasn&rsquo;t that I liked being a villainess, but that was my role. The prince&rsquo;s consort had to be able to carry herself. That&rsquo;s what I once believed, at least.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Melody&rsquo;s expression softened, though traces of resentment lingered. &ldquo;Rosalind, you really are a fool,&rdquo; she muttered, though there was no malice in her tone. Not once did her eyes leave Rosalind&rsquo;s arms, where the scars had been. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Rosalind chuckled softly. &ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s something we can finally agree on, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Glancing back at the doors leading into the ballroom, she took a deep breath. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Melody&hellip; I&rsquo;m about to do something reckless. But first&hellip;&rdquo; She turned, pulling her friend into a gentle hug. Melody stiffened in surprise, clearly unprepared, but she didn&rsquo;t resist it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have tea with you sometime. Just&hellip; as friends.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Before Melody could respond, Rosalind released her and stepped back inside, her heart pounding with a new resolve.

Melody watched from the balcony door, fearing something bad was about to happen. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lady Rosalind,&rdquo; Vicente replied, his tone cool, but his face full of dread. &ldquo;Must you disrupt such a joyous evening with your whims?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But this isn&rsquo;t one of those whims, your majesty. I know I&rsquo;ve made many, but this is the complete opposite.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then what is it you wish to declare, Lady Rosalind? Your hatred, perhaps? Or maybe your opposition?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Rosalind smiled, but it was a small, sad smile. &ldquo;I simply wish to declare my apology,&rdquo; she said, her voice quiet but unwavering. &ldquo;And&hellip; my desire to end our engagement.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">The room erupted in gasps that were louder than the last. This time, they were followed by whispers.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c11">&ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Ending their engagement?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s truly gone mad!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Even Melody stood in complete shock and disbelief. &ldquo;Rosalind, what are you doing?&rdquo; she whispered.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&#8203;&#8203;Rosalind looked back at her, a faint smile tugging at her lips, as though telling her to trust her. &ldquo;Shh,&rdquo; she mouthed, a strange calmness emanating from her despite the intense scrutiny of the crowd.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vicente&rsquo;s expression hardened to one of suspicion. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;End the engagement?&rdquo; he echoed, his voice laced with incredulity. &ldquo;Do you really mean that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind nodded. &ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; she said, raising her hand, and from behind her, Bethany stepped forward, holding out a tied bundle of parchment. She took it, presenting it to the prince. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve even prepared the necessary papers. You just need to sign them, Your Majesty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vicente let out a bitter chuckle, regarding the papers with disdain. &ldquo;And what reason do I have to believe this sudden change of heart? You have nothing to gain from this, Rosalind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind met his gaze, her own eyes filled with regret and solemnity. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to believe me, your majesty. I just want to atone for all I&rsquo;ve done to you both. Nothing I did is worth forgiving, and by doing all those things, I&rsquo;ve made myself unworthy of being the queen of this nation.&rdquo; She turned to Marciella, who flinched at her gaze. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;m relinquishing my role to you, Lady Marciella.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mariella, who was still processing the shock of everything, looked to the ground. &ldquo;But Lady Rosalind&hellip; why now? There&rsquo;s no forgiving what you&rsquo;ve done thus far, but&hellip; you were given the right to stand by Prince Vicente, and I took that from you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind said nothing for a few seconds. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Lady Marciella,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;It is difficult for me to make this decision. But I must let go of what I cannot have. He loves you, and he never loved me. I was blind to what simply couldn&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vicente and Marciella exchanged glances. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it you want, Lady Rosalind?&rdquo; Vicente asked carefully, doubt still clear in his eyes. &ldquo;An alimony? An expensive piece of land? A new territory?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A wide smile formed on Rosalind&rsquo;s face. It was a smile that contained resignation, sadness, happiness, and content all at the same time. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she said simply.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vicente tilted his head. &ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Rosalind repeated. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Marciella frowned. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want anything, Lady Rosalind? Not even a memento or keepsake?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind eyed her with that same smile. Even now, when her worst enemy was facing her comeuppance, Marciella couldn&rsquo;t help but act with kindness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need a thing,&rdquo; Rosalind admitted, her smile fading and her heart heavy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already taken enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The room went silent as everyone considered her words. This was an unprecedented series of events, especially for someone like her. How could the notorious villainess so willingly end her engagement? And why was she not demanding anything in the divorce? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her family also watched in stunned silence. Eliza didn&rsquo;t fully understand everything, but even she thought it was strange that Rosalind was ending her engagement. Didn&rsquo;t she love the prince? Why was her older sister giving it all up?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody stood with a conflicted expression, wondering how to feel. On one hand she was glad to see Rosalind so humbled in front of a crowd. But at the same time, she felt bad for her. She wanted to embrace Rosalind and comfort her after such a tough decision. What was she to do?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not hearing a response from Vicente or Marciella, Rosalind bowed, her emotional restraint on overdrive as she left them with one final statement. &ldquo;Prince Vicente, Lady Marciella, once again, I am deeply sorry for everything. I wish you both nothing but happiness. When the time comes, I&rsquo;ll gladly sign the papers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that, she turned and left the ballroom, leaving a quiet, conflicted crowd in her wake.</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind sat outside on a bench in one of the imperial castle&rsquo;s gardens. She was surrounded by all kinds of exotic flowers, but she didn&rsquo;t notice any of them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;All&rsquo;s well that ends well, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind frowned. Tears formed in her eyes and her head fell into her hands. She sobbed loudly on that bench, her cries probably loud enough for others to hear, but she didn&rsquo;t care. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sure, this was the best course of action. She had to end their fruitless relationship. But that didn&rsquo;t mean she wasn&rsquo;t hurt. After all, she really did love Prince Vicente. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now that she saw how happy they were together, along with their expressions of relief when she declared her intention to end the engagement, she was crushed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind had come to detest love, but that didn&rsquo;t stop her from still feeling it and wanting it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As she sat there, lost in her thoughts, a figure approached from the shadows. The man was dressed in an inconspicuous dark blue suit. He moved with a quiet grace, almost as if he belonged to the night itself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My lady,&rdquo; he said softly, his voice gentle and comforting. &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind me joining you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind turned, her tear-streaked face meeting the stranger&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she asked, her voice trembling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is a pleasure to meet you, Lady Rosalind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My name is Duke Francis.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Duke Francis? Ah... the so-called &lsquo;Shadow Duke?&rsquo;&rdquo; she repeated, recognizing the title from court rumors. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see you at the gathering tonight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I tend to avoid such occasions,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t help but overhear your words just now. Is it true you chose to end your engagement?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind frowned. &ldquo;I did what I had to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re clearly hurt, my lady,&rdquo; he said, grabbing her hand softly. &ldquo;Why do you cry for someone who hurt you so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was the one who hurt him!&rdquo; Rosalind cried, tears pouring from her eyes against her will. &ldquo;I was the one who ruined any chances I might have had.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis frowned. &ldquo;Is the fianc&eacute; truly at fault when her man loves another?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind nodded sadly. &ldquo;She is if she doesn&rsquo;t accept the truth and move on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis looked at her with compassion. &ldquo;But love isn&rsquo;t easy like that, is it? Even if you know the truth, you love them enough to deny it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You seem to know everything.&rdquo; Rosalind chuckled, her laughter mixing with tears. &ldquo;I wish I had never fallen in love.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis smiles. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something we can never control.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you have someone you love?&rdquo; Rosalind asked curiously. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis made a knowing look. &ldquo;You could say that. But I think she&rsquo;s forgotten me by now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind grimaced at his words. &ldquo;How can you love someone like that?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis chuckled. &ldquo;Like I said, love is something we can never control.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind looked to the ground. &ldquo;What am I supposed to do now?&rdquo; she asked sadly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can ever get rid of these sad feelings.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis laced his hands together thoughtfully. &ldquo;In times like these,&rdquo; he started, &ldquo;you should talk to someone about how you feel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind looked away, her face shadowed with doubt. &ldquo;I... I don&rsquo;t know how to do that. Who would even care to listen?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis pointed at himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind studied him, her curiosity piqued despite her sadness. &ldquo;But why would you want to help me? You don&rsquo;t even know me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis&rsquo; expression softened, his eyes filled with a quiet understanding. &ldquo;Sometimes, we don&rsquo;t need to know someone to offer a bit of kindness.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind felt a strange sense of ease in his presence, a feeling she couldn&rsquo;t quite explain. &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; she asked quietly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I deserve comfort, but... I suppose it&rsquo;s nice to have someone to talk to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis nodded, placing a hand on Rosalind&rsquo;s own. &ldquo;Everyone deserves a moment to let themselves free.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind leaned against the back of the bench, taking a deep breath. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a difficult few weeks. I guess you could say I had a moment of revelation. I realized I&rsquo;ve been looking past all the people around me, not appreciating their efforts and their love for me. Now I&rsquo;m trying my hardest to make up for it, but I&rsquo;ve felt so full of guilt.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis remained silent, allowing her to speak freely. Rosalind continued, her voice wavering as she spoke of her regrets, her hopes for redemption, and the emotional turmoil she was experiencing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He nodded thoughtfully at every word. &ldquo;You want to make amends,&rdquo; he said in understanding. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t feel that your actions are worth forgiving.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind eyed him in surprise. &ldquo;You explained my feelings perfectly,&rdquo; she said, chuckling softly. &ldquo;It really does feel better to talk with someone who understands.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure anyone could understand that feeling, Lady Rosalind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just how life is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;Duke Francis, let&rsquo;s talk some more. You can call me Rosalind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course, Rosalind,&rdquo; Francis said warmly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the night wore on, the two of them shared a quiet conversation, talking about life, society, politics, any topics they could think of. Rosalind found a strange solace in Francis&rsquo; presence, his comforting and gentle words slowly bringing her out of her sadness. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The night eventually drew to a close, and Rosalind felt a sense of calm she hadn&rsquo;t experienced in days. The castle gardens were wonderful, Francis was wonderful, and for some odd reason, Rosalind herself felt wonderful. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After talking with Francis, she had come to realize that maybe it wasn&rsquo;t so bad for her to end such an unrequited love. Perhaps it was truly possible for her to move on. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they stood up to part ways, Rosalind turned to Francis with a smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said shyly. &ldquo;For sitting and talking with me. It really helped.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis smiled in return. &ldquo;It was my pleasure, Rosalind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind looked to the ground at his words, her face growing hot. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um, Francis&hellip;&rdquo; she started, her cheeks tinged with red. &ldquo;Shall we have tea sometime?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A hint of surprise flickered in his expression, followed by an affectionate nod. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what you want, then yes, I would be honored.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then&hellip; I&rsquo;ll send you a letter,&rdquo; Rosalind said, allowing her gaze to linger on him for a moment longer, before she turned to leave. &ldquo;Goodnight, Francis.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Goodnight, Rosalind,&rdquo; Francis replied, bowing slightly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind took a breath, her heart feeling lighter as she turned back towards the castle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The night was certainly not an easy one, there were many difficulties, and the aftermath was not what Rosalind expected, but as she rejoined her family, she carried with her the comfort of a new ally. </span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c22" id="h.hdzj7o72moa1"><span class="c18">Chapter 8 - The Most Admirable Woman In The World</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When did Melody first start seeing the signs of change within her dearest friend?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It wasn&rsquo;t at Prince Vicente&rsquo;s birthday party, though Rosalind&rsquo;s strange behavior left her surprised for many days afterward. No, it was on a fateful day she couldn&rsquo;t forget, four years ago. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those days, Melody and Rosalind were the best of friends. They had tea parties nearly every day, and though they came from different backgrounds, Melody being from a family of poor merchants and Rosalind being the daughter of rich nobles, they didn&rsquo;t let titles define them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They always got themselves dirty, playing in the gardens, planting flowers, experimenting with petal color pigments. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody had accepted the friendship with Rosalind because of her own circumstances. When she was only four, she lost her beloved mother. But Rosalind was by her side, distracting her with the festival that occurred on the same day, and with her help, Melody was able to escape the sadness she felt. It had become a tradition to visit that festival.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody found herself relying on Rosalind for everything. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She just couldn&rsquo;t help it; Rosalind was too kind, and she matured very fast. Melody had to work desperately just to catch up with her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But she didn&rsquo;t hate that. Melody cared for Rosalind deeply, despite their differences.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, one day, something seemed to change. Melody had noticed Rosalind&rsquo;s subtle change in priorities over the years, but she truly felt the brunt of it when her best friend failed to show up to meet her at the festival. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With a painful distance growing between them, Rosalind finally sent Melody an invite to tea. But &nbsp;that tea party wasn&rsquo;t cordial in the slightest. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tell me Rosalind!&rdquo; Melody cried, tears threatening to fall from her eyes. &ldquo;Why are you pushing me away?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind kept her back turned, her voice barely audible as she murmured, &ldquo;The Crown Prince is going to be my fianc&eacute;. If I am to be worthy of him, I mustn&#39;t get distracted.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You abandoned me!&rdquo; Melody&rsquo;s sadness flared into anger, unable to understand why the title of fianc&eacute;e could erase years of friendship. &ldquo;That was our day, our promise. You didn&rsquo;t even tell me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mel&mdash; Lady Melody,&rdquo; Rosalind said in a tone so quiet it felt like a whisper. &ldquo;Please&hellip; go home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c16">Melody&rsquo;s eyes flared with fury. &ldquo;Did you just call me </span><span class="c16 c17">lady</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo; She forcefully grabbed Rosalind by the shoulders and spun her around to face her. &ldquo;So after everything, you&rsquo;re just dropping all the signs of friendship we had? No more gardening, no more tea times, not even a lack of formality?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind hardened her face. &ldquo;As a consort, I shouldn&rsquo;t associate so freely with someone of&hellip; the lower class.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody pushed her away, her face now red with all of the hatred she had been holding back until this very moment. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I should have known,&rdquo; she hissed, gritting her teeth. &ldquo;I should have known this was your true nature. You always had everything I could have never dreamed of. I held back my jealousy because I liked you so much as a friend, but did you even feel the same way?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody approached her closer and closer. &ldquo;Perhaps this was all a game to you. Was it fun making fun of me, pretending to build a friendship with someone who cared so much for you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind slapped her across the face. Her eyes were cold and stern. It was like there was no childhood cheerfulness left in her. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody held her cheek in surprise, before tears streamed down her face. &ldquo;Why&hellip;?&rdquo; she whimpered. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you deny any of my words? I just wanted you&hellip; to deny them&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind said nothing for a few minutes and then sighed. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lady Melody, I no longer want to see you at this house,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;Get out. Now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody froze, her heart pounding as she grasped the bitter reality of their parting. At the door, she looked back one last time, her voice barely more than a murmur. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I wish I had never become friends with you, Rosalind,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;Life would have been easier without it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And with that final note, she left the room. That was the last time Melody ever saw Rosalind as her best friend.</span></p><hr><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody had seen the signs. She could tell Rosalind had changed from the girl she used to be, and she really hated it. But she just couldn&rsquo;t forgive Rosalind for what she had done. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As she left on that day, Melody decided that she wouldn&rsquo;t allow herself to rely on Rosalind anymore. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were no more tea parties, no more childish playdates, no more playing in general. Melody threw her old life away and buried herself under work and education. She attended the academy and drained herself everyday to make it to the top of her classes. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">By the time two years passed, she had become smarter than any other person in the entire country. With her expertise and skills, she managed to expand her family&rsquo;s merchant business into a merchant empire. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her exhaustive efforts eventually lifted her family&rsquo;s name to one of the most well known in the entire country, and she even became the heir over her brothers. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were some who looked down on her because of her poor upbringing, but everyone else admired her. Melody had become one of the most admirable ladies of the entire empire. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No one would dare insult her to her face. But they didn&rsquo;t need to. She had her ways of finding out those who whispered and cursed her name. And when she did, they would immediately regret it. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But ever so often, Melody would find herself thinking of her friend Rosalind. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Why had she changed so much? Why had they become enemies? Was this all worth it?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No traces of friendship existed between them. Their relationship had become a rivalry, and they often traded insults at parties and events. Melody didn&rsquo;t particularly like it. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But what could she do? Rosalind was clearly a different person, there was no going back to the days they once shared. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody didn&rsquo;t like that either.</span></p><hr><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, it seemed Melody had been struck with a strange case of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Prince Vicente&rsquo;s birthday party was an event that Melody dreaded attending for a variety of reasons. She never liked parties, they reminded her of her background, and she hated the hateful whispers. Most of all, she really hated quarreling with Rosalind. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But for once in a long while, she had been entertained by one of these parties. Why? Because Rosalind had acted like her old self. It had been so long since Melody saw Rosalind&rsquo;s kindness, and her earnest apologies were apparent. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody just couldn&rsquo;t understand why this had happened. She had seen Rosalind change once before. Why was she changing again? And this time she was seemingly reverting? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s genuine words also stuck out to her. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c11">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have tea with you sometime. Just&hellip; as friends.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Melody still remembered the feeling of her arms, the warmth she felt when her old friend hugged her like she used to. She couldn&rsquo;t help but feel emotional. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Those words replayed themselves in her mind, over and over as she sat looking out the window of her estate that night.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why&hellip;?&rdquo; Melody muttered aloud, staring into the darkness. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t understand you, Rosalind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Why had Rosalind chosen to abandon her all these years? Why did she choose love over her best friend, who had always been by her side? </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c0">And was there a way for them to make up? Could she truly forgive Rosalind?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody looked to the ground and thought for a moment.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It wasn&rsquo;t going to be easy. She knew that for certain. But she had to try. She had to believe her old friend was still in there, waiting for her to pull her out of whatever hell she had gotten herself into. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What did Melody have to lose? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Morgan,&rdquo; she called to her maid, &ldquo;Could you bring me some ink and parchment?&rdquo;</span></p><h3 class="c15" id="h.8ulytsi8rsbe"><span class="c18">Interlude 5 - A Family Is Like A Circle (Nicole M.

Her face lit up when she saw him approach.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eliza, have you seen your older sister?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking everywhere.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in the library, father,&rdquo; Eliza replied with a bright smile. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been there for hours. I think she&rsquo;s working on something important.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His brows lifted in surprise. &ldquo;The library?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as Eliza said, Rosalind was in the library, pouring over large stacks of books as she sat at one of the wooden tables. Her head was bent low, her expression focused as she took long, extensive notes, her hand moving swiftly across the parchment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her father took a glimpse at her surroundings and was flabbergasted. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rosalind?&rdquo; he called, stepping further inside. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She glanced up, startled, and then a nervous blush crept into her cheeks. &ldquo;Oh, father,&rdquo; she said, gathering herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just doing some studying.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He cast his eyes over the books, noting the toughness of the subjects&mdash;business, politics, economics, history, and more. &ldquo;Just for fun?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind glanced at her notes. &ldquo;Not exactly. I&rsquo;ve been thinking... I&rsquo;d like to become the family heir, father.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Her father sat down next to her, taking in the gravity of her words. &ldquo;Rosalind, I had no idea. You&rsquo;ve never shown an interest in these affairs before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve started thinking about the future, father,&rdquo; Rosalind said. &ldquo;Melody has done a lot to help her family, but I&rsquo;ve done nothing. It was fine when I was the prince&rsquo;s consort, but now that I&rsquo;m just a noblewoman, I&rsquo;ve got to make an effort.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lord Harcourt listened carefully, processing her unexpected words. Rosalind, his once carefree daughter, had always seemed more interested in leisure and fun. This new determination, however, was a side of her he hadn&rsquo;t ever expected. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Becoming the family heir isn&rsquo;t an easy task&hellip;&rdquo; he began, choosing his words carefully. &ldquo;It requires discipline, resilience, and an unyielding commitment. You may end up facing unexpected challenges.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She met his gaze, unwavering. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve gone through worse. I can do this, father.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A gentle smile crossed his face, his eyes filled with admiration. &ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; he said, a hint of pride sneaking into his voice. &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re going to try this, I want to help you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her mouth opened, about to protest. &ldquo;But father, you don&rsquo;t have to&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he interrupted gently but firmly. &ldquo;And you can&rsquo;t convince me otherwise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind made a resigned smile and sighed. &ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; she agreed, nodding softly. &ldquo;Thank you, father.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For the rest of the morning, Rosalind and her father sat side by side, navigating through the nuances of business and estate management. They discussed complex economic principles, taxation, trade agreements, and the importance of diplomacy. Rosalind listened intently to every word her father told her, her pen flying across the parchment as she dictated every important detail. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For several long nights, Rosalind also studied the books within her father&rsquo;s study, forgoing any chance of a good night sleep. She woke up exhausted each day, but to Rosalind, this was worth it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Change doesn&rsquo;t happen easily, after all. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her father continued to encourage and support her, supplying her with any information she requested. And when she wasn&rsquo;t studying with him, Rosalind turned to his assistant, a man named Mr. Caldwell, whose extensive knowledge of the manor&rsquo;s operations made him a prime source of learning. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One afternoon, Rosalind and Mr. Caldwell stood outside, discussing the logistics of the estate&rsquo;s gardens. He pointed to the arrangement of various elements, like the flowers, the sidewalks, and the benches. Everything was placed where it was for a reason. Rosalind made mental notes of all the placement specifics. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve taken on quite a monumental task, Miss Rosalind,&rdquo; Mr. Caldwell observed, giving her an approving smile. &ldquo;Few heirs are as hands-on as you seem to be. I&rsquo;d wager your brothers have much to reckon with.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I want to understand every aspect of our family&rsquo;s estate, Mr. Caldwell,&rdquo; she replied, looking out at the aging greenhouse in the distance. &ldquo;This place, especially&hellip; It&#39;s important to me. I&rsquo;ve forsaken it for far too long.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Word of Rosalind&rsquo;s transformation and efforts began to spread beyond the manor&rsquo;s walls. Servants exchanged whispers, marveling at her diligence, her ability to learn, and her attempts to learn about the lives of all the workers. She didn&rsquo;t leave a single stone unturned. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the weeks that followed, rumors circulated throughout the empire of Lady Rosalind&rsquo;s desire to become the Harcourt family heir. There were plenty of mixed reactions&mdash;some believed Rosalind was attempting to gain power, while others were inspired by her strength, in a world where female heirs were rare. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her brothers, Felix and Harold, had mixed feelings as well. One tense evening, as the family gathered for dinner, Felix&rsquo;s concern surfaced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rosalind,&rdquo; he began gently, resting a hand on her shoulder, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been working too hard. This isn&rsquo;t the right path for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; her brother Harold, always the pragmatist, nodded in agreement. &ldquo;The people of this empire won&rsquo;t accept a female heir so easily. Let your brothers handle this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eliza shot them both a glare, crossing her arms defiantly. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re both wrong!&rdquo; she huffed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have Rose as the heir than either of you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lord Harcourt laughed, his gaze warm as he regarded Rosalind with pride. &ldquo;Rosalind is perfectly capable of participating in the bid for family heir,&rdquo; he said with a smile. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no rule that disqualifies her from her birthright.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rosalind, why have you been so silent?&rdquo; Harold asked, pointing at her. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re talking about you, you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind shrugged with a smile. &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ve already been spoken for.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the end, Harold and Felix also started helping Rosalind with her efforts. They taught her a lot of the knowledge they learned to become potential heirs, until they all were sharing information back and forth. It was becoming clearer by the day that the bid for family heir was not going to be easy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind wondered whether she could truly triumph over her brothers, but deep down they knew she was almost better than them. She simply learned quickly, memorized minute details with ease, and was willing to get her hands dirty for the sake of her goal. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How could they compete with that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the midst of her self-doubt, Rosalind received a message that she had been waiting for. A letter arrived at the estate, a simple yet elegantly sealed envelope bearing the well-known insignia of the Astrale Merchant Company. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s hands trembled slightly as she opened it, her eyes widening as she read the familiar handwriting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">Dear Rosalind,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">The path you&rsquo;ve chosen isn&rsquo;t an easy one, and I would like to extend an invitation to tea so we can talk about it. I&rsquo;m eager to hear more about your life and to reconnect. It has been too long since we last sat together as friends, and I&rsquo;m willing to help you in your pursuits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11">Warm regards,<br>Melody</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind felt her heart twist at Melody&rsquo;s warm words. Even after everything she had done to her, her friend was still willing to reach out. She desperately wanted to accept the invitation, yet her responsibilities weighed heavily on her mind. Taking a deep breath, she tucked the letter safely into her desk drawer, deciding she would make time to see Melody once her studies allowed for it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the days passed, Rosalind&rsquo;s dedication impressed her father more and more. She studied tirelessly, asked complex questions, took lots of notes, and practiced her knowledge with impressive tact. Lord Harcourt was growing more certain of his choice, even knowing his sons&rsquo; skills. He knew who was best suited for the role of heir. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One evening, as they sat in his study reviewing financial documents, he finally voiced the sentiment that had been growing in his heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rosalind,&rdquo; he began softly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve shown me that you&rsquo;re more than capable of this role. I think your brothers already realized it, but I believe you are the one who should become the heir to this family.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind looked up, her expression a mix of surprise and emotion. &ldquo;Father&hellip; thank you so much,&rdquo; she exclaimed, pulling him into a big hug. &ldquo;It means so much to hear you say that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For the first time in years, Rosalind felt truly connected with her father. She had drifted away from her family in her quest for love, but now that she focused on those around her, she felt an overwhelming sense of affection. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She had always been scared, afraid of showing weakness in the face of her great love for her family, and it led to their deaths. Now, here in her father&rsquo;s arms, she didn&rsquo;t want to let them go, to make them suffer for her sake ever again. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And in the back of her mind, the thought of reconnecting with Melody lingered. Perhaps, after all these years, Rosalind could bridge the gap she had created.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c22" id="h.q686o0fp9ues"><span class="c18">Chapter 10 - A Partnership Rekindling</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind embraced her new role easily. She worked harder than she ever had before, but she accepted it all willingly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of her first decisions was something she had been thinking about for some time. In her previous life, there was a knight who served her diligently. However, she betrayed Rosalind in the end because of the terrible treatment she faced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind recalled how she had forced Silke to carry out reprehensible acts under the guise of loyalty, tarnishing the knight&#39;s honor and dignity. She knew that she could not move forward until she confronted this part of her past.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All she remembered was that her name was Silke, and that she was underappreciated. But it was up to Rosalind to find her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once she did, there was something she had to do. Silke always wanted to live a life of honor, to serve a master who would appreciate her efforts. Rosalind hadn&rsquo;t been that master in her past life. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But she was going to make it happen in this one. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bethany, I need you to find someone,&rdquo; Rosalind said, handing her a piece of paper with information on it. &ldquo;Her name is Silke and she&rsquo;s good with swords.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bethany studied the paper and nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask one of the family&rsquo;s informants. We&rsquo;ll find her, my lady.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind managed a grateful smile. &quot;Thank you, Bethany. You&rsquo;re always so diligent.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bethany returned her smile. &quot;Of course, my lady.&quot;</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that task taken care of, it was now time for Rosalind&rsquo;s next important task. It was time to have tea with Melody. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind arrived at the Astrale Merchant Company mansion earlier than she was supposed to. She had been rather nervous, and acted out of a fear that Melody may rescind the offer. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She braced herself as Melody came to greet her in the drawing room. Her expression was stern as she entered, and she simply stared at Rosalind without saying anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Melody, I&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before Rosalind could say another word, Melody pulled her into a tight hug. Rosalind&rsquo;s eyes went wide in surprise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You stubborn fool&hellip;&rdquo; Melody whispered, tears gathering in her eyes. &ldquo;Do you have any idea how long I&rsquo;ve waited for you to apologize? Do you know how long I&rsquo;ve waited for you to simply invite me for tea?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Taken aback, Rosalind wrapped her arms around Melody, her voice soft.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, Melody. I know I hurt you terribly&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course you did!&rdquo; Melody exclaimed. &ldquo;I cried for days&hellip; I just wanted you to tell me it was all a joke, a big game. But you never did. And we became rivals. I never wanted to be your enemy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind looked to the ground. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I can make it up to you,&rdquo; she started, reaching into her bag to pull out a set of meticulously prepared documents, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d like to show you this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody took the document and studied it intently with the critical eye of a business professional. Her eyes then went wide in surprise. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The rights to the Dno Mine,&rdquo; Rosalind finished with a smile. &ldquo;I want to make a deal with you, Melody.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A deal?&rdquo; Melody eyed her curiously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t make deals recklessly, you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; nodded Rosalind. &ldquo;But that changes when it comes to diamonds and rare crystals.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you suggesting?&rdquo; Melody asked curiously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This,&rdquo; Rosalind responded, handing her a cleanly written contract. &ldquo;I am willing to give you a small portion of this mine. In exchange, I become a prime investor in your company.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no small deal,&rdquo; Melody noted, her eyes wide. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But your company would benefit from the ores in our mine,&rdquo; Rosalind pointed out. &ldquo;Not to mention, you&rsquo;d gain a highly influential investor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody considered her words for a few seconds. &ldquo;Fifty percent,&rdquo; she offered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mmm&hellip; how about thirty percent?&rdquo; Rosalind countered. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Forty-five,&rdquo; Melody countered back. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind shook her head. &ldquo;Forty, final offer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;...alright. Forty it is,&rdquo; Melody said with a smile. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a sneaky negotiator, Rosalind.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not as sneaky as you, Melody,&rdquo; Rosalind said, also smiling. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They stared at each other and then laughed together for the first time in several years. In that laughter, the years of rivalry and resentment began to fade away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I missed you, Rosalind,&rdquo; Melody said happily. &ldquo;I missed this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I feel the same way,&rdquo; Rosalind said through her laughter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They signed the contract, sealing the deal, establishing them as partners. For the rest of their time together, Rosalind and Melody talked about their lives, their future plans, and other topics they could think of. It had been so long since they talked, they just didn&rsquo;t want to end it so easily. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So I heard you&rsquo;ve been working to become the family heir?&rdquo; Melody inquired. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, I was inspired by you, Melody,&rdquo; Rosalind admitted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re really strong, I don&rsquo;t know how you did it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody&rsquo;s smile was soft, almost wistful. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t easy. But I had to keep trying.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind frowned. &ldquo;I suppose that was my fault.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; Melody admitted. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s all in the past. We&rsquo;re here now, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind smiled. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The festival is coming up, isn&rsquo;t it? Would you like to go with me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody smiled. &ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;d love to.&rdquo;</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That evening, Rosalind returned to the manor with a cheerful disposition. Her happiness from making up with Melody was clear in her face. She found Bethany waiting in her chambers, a parchment clutched in her hands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Welcome back, my lady,&rdquo; Bethany said with a respectful bow. &ldquo;I found the person you were looking for.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s heart raced as she took the note from Bethany and scanned it. Her eyes widened with recognition as the details came flooding back. Silke, her once-loyal knight, had indeed once been a member of the Assassin&rsquo;s Guild&mdash;a dangerous place Rosalind unfortunately knew all too well from her former life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now I remember. She was from the Assassin&rsquo;s Guild.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My lady, are you going back to the guild?&rdquo; Bethany asked worriedly. &ldquo;That place is dangerous, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Bethany,&rdquo; Rosalind said with a smile. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t plan to use their services. And I can handle myself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bethany nodded with an understanding smile, though concern flickered in her eyes. &ldquo;Just be careful, my lady.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind spent the rest of the evening preparing for her upcoming plan. She knew it would be ridiculous for her to barge in asking for a guild member without proper reasoning. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But she had to pull it off, whether it was possible or not. She owed it to her loyal night, the girl who simply wanted to live a life of honor, but was denied it because of her master&rsquo;s mistakes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This scenario also couldn&rsquo;t have been more perfect for Rosalind. With this information, she could cut all ties with the Assassin&rsquo;s Guild and free Silke at the same time. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She just hoped nothing would go wrong.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c22" id="h.rdldhtul3yh2"><span class="c18">Chapter 11 - Honorable Paladin</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind sat in an inconspicuous restaurant, scanning her surroundings. The place was exactly as she remembered, a frankly disturbing facade that concealed the deadly secrets that lay beneath the surface. For most people, it looked like an average, modest eatery. But Rosalind knew better. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was here to fulfill an important mission, a rescue of someone who once served her with the utmost honor. Of course, it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to infiltrate such a dangerous guild.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind glanced at the gruff waiter who approached her, taking in his suspicious form. He was obviously far too gruff and muscular to be a simple waiter, but only someone looking for those details would notice them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What would you like to order?&rdquo; he asked, his tone laced with a vague hint of warning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind started, pretending to observe the menu. There was a code to enter the guild, but if she uttered it too easily, it would look suspicious. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take an orange sherbet&hellip; with a hint of cherry limeade,&rdquo; Rosalind said softly, letting her voice carry just enough to reach him and no one else.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To any casual onlooker, it might sound like an exotic but harmless order. But to those who knew the ways of the Assassin&rsquo;s Guild, it was a password, the entryway to the underworld. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The waiter&rsquo;s expression didn&rsquo;t change, but he nodded, casting a quick glance toward a door in the back. &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; he whispered gruffly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind followed him through a secret passage, down a long, winding flight of stairs. Flickering torches illuminated the rough faces of assassins going to and fro. Several distrusting eyes glanced at her as she entered the busy hall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">An even gruffer man approached her, his gaze piercing. &ldquo;What do you want? You were here before, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind met his eyes without flinching. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied calmly, her voice carrying a hint of regret. &ldquo;I would like to rescind my offer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16">&ldquo;Rescind?&rdquo; he echoed, his voice laced with contempt. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just </span><span class="c16 c17">rescind </span><span class="c0">a guild offer. You know too much about us. That makes you a liability.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;m not a fool,&rdquo; Rosalind snapped. &ldquo;I want to make an exchange.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She pulled a hefty bag of coins and gemstones from her cloak. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give you the payment I would have paid for the prior services,&rdquo; she said smoothly. &ldquo;And in exchange, I want to take one of your weaker members for myself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man raised an eyebrow, the weight of the bag clearly tempting him. &ldquo;Weaker members? You mean the slaves?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind grimaced at the word, but nodded. &ldquo;Yes. I want the girl called Silke.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a tense pause, the gruffer man relented, shouting over his shoulder, &ldquo;I have a client looking for Silke! Get her out here!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moments later, Silke was brought before them, her thin form and weary eyes immediately apparent to Rosalind. She frowned at the poor girl&rsquo;s condition. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was undoubtedly the strong knight she remembered, but in her current state, she looked terrible. It was a hard sight to behold. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Here she is,&rdquo; the gruffer man sneered, rudely pushing her forward. &ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re paying, we&rsquo;ll let you have her and forget any of this ever happened.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you understand,&rdquo; Rosalind said with a nod. She grabbed Silke by the arm and guided her back up the stairs.</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They emerged into the night air, the weight of the guild&rsquo;s darkness left behind. Rosalind eyed Silke&rsquo;s bruised arms, noticing the rope tied around them with a frown. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That must hurt,&rdquo; Rosalind said softly, pulling a small knife from her pouch. She severed the ropes as fast as she could. &ldquo;I suppose I should introduce myself?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My name is Rosalind Harcourt,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;You must be Silke.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke studied her freed hands and looked at Rosalind with wide, mistrusting eyes. &ldquo;Why did you buy me?&rdquo; she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because I need you,&rdquo; Rosalind responded simply. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke&rsquo;s expression turned skeptical. &ldquo;Everyone says they need me&hellip; but I always get sent back in the end.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not going to happen on my watch,&rdquo; Rosalind said with a gentle smile. &ldquo;I want to hire you as my personal knight, Silke. In exchange, I&rsquo;m going to give you what you always wanted.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And how would you know anything about what I want?&rdquo; Silke asked, suspicious of her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t answer that,&rdquo; Rosalind admitted, thinking back on terrible memories from her past life. &ldquo;But I know you wish to live a life of honor. By serving me, I will give you the chance you&rsquo;ve always longed for.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke&rsquo;s gaze dropped, her hands clenched at her sides. &ldquo;Everyone who&rsquo;s ever claimed to care about me has used me&hellip; so why should I trust you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind made a wistful smile. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t. But I want you to either way.&rdquo;</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke&rsquo;s first week at the Harcourt Estate was more luxurious than she had ever imagined. Despite only being a knight, she was treated with all the amenities she could ever want. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that didn&rsquo;t stop her suspicions. She didn&rsquo;t know if she could trust Rosalind. Why was she being so kind to her? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke spoke with every servant in an attempt to learn more about her new master, but each bit of information created more and more confusion. Everyone seemed to praise her hardworking efforts as the new family heir, but did that mean she was trustworthy? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or was she using Silke as part of some plan she didn&rsquo;t know about? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One night, as Silke wandered the dimly lit hallways, she overheard Rosalind and her maid Bethany talking in the study.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;s settling in well?&rdquo; Rosalind asked, a note of concern in her voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She is, my lady,&rdquo; Bethany replied. &ldquo;Though she remains wary. I suppose it won&rsquo;t be easy for her to trust us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind sighed. &ldquo;I know. She has every reason to doubt me. But I truly want to give her the life she deserves. I only hope she&rsquo;ll come to understand that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke&rsquo;s heart clenched. She slipped back to her room before they noticed her, further questions swirling through her mind. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why would a noblewoman like Rosalind go to such lengths to help her? The kindness she received was very welcome, but a cynical part of her felt that it was all too good to be true. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And as Silke slowly drifted off to sleep that night, her worries remained clear in her mind. Almost too clear. </span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In her dreams, Silke saw a vision that left her deeply shaken. It was of a time she would never know or understand, but for a broken moment in time, she saw the future that once was. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She stood in a grand but messy room, where Rosalind appeared before her, disheveled and manic, her eyes hollow with a desperation that bordered on madness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How could it have failed?&rdquo; Rosalind cried out, her voice a jagged echo. She picked up a nearby vase and threw it across the room, shattering it into pieces. &ldquo;I double-checked every step! The plan was fool-proof!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke stood with her sword drawn as she watched Rosalind&rsquo;s hysterical actions. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s words grew more feverish, her expression twisted with rage. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t that girl just die already?! And who dared to help her?&rdquo; Her gaze fixed on Silke, suspicion dawning. &ldquo;Was it you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke&rsquo;s heart hammered in her chest. She didn&rsquo;t know why, but the words slipped out before she could stop them. &ldquo;Yes&hellip; I helped her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s face contorted with betrayal. &ldquo;You ingrate. After everything I&rsquo;ve done, this is how you repay me?&rdquo; She started to approach her, but Silke subconsciously made a slice with her blade. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind stumbled, clutching her now-bleeding leg. She glared at Silke, who didn&rsquo;t flinch. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke lowered her weapon, her voice choked. &ldquo;I once thought I could serve you with honor, but now you&rsquo;ve shown me nothing but evil. You&rsquo;ve become a monster.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind let out a hollow laugh, the sound carrying a sense of tragic inevitability. &ldquo;When everyone calls you a monster, it&rsquo;s easy to become one, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The vision faded as Rosalind&rsquo;s laughter reverberated in the darkness.</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Making use of the Harcourt Family&rsquo;s expansive training grounds, Silke practiced her swordsmanship every day. It was the best method for her to calm her nerves. If she stopped and was left to sit for too long, she would start to think too much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke preferred action over thinking. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She could still remember the vision from the previous night, the feeling of waking up in a cold sweat, and the broken expression Rosalind had displayed. Those images couldn&rsquo;t have been normal, could they? It was all too real. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was why Silke preferred action. She didn&rsquo;t like thinking about these sorts of things, she didn&rsquo;t want to doubt people, but it was in her nature. She also had no reason to doubt Rosalind, as the noblewoman had provided her with so many generous things. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How could she not feel grateful? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But why was it that she saw that vision? Could she reasonably accept Rosalind&rsquo;s kindness, knowing what she had seen? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke poured herself into hours of endless sword training, letting the exhilarating feeling of the blade distract her. Still, she couldn&rsquo;t help imagining the vision, in which she had deliberately hurt Rosalind. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c17">I want to forget it all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke screamed internally, swinging her sword with all her might. Her swings were powerful and required a lot of energy, but in the midst of her turbulent thoughts, she barely registered the concept of &lsquo;exhaustion&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been working hard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke turned to see Bethany walking towards her, carrying a tray laden with food and drink.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Miss Bethany? Why are you here in the training grounds?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bethany smiled, setting the tray down. &ldquo;Lady Rosalind wanted me to bring you food and drink,&rdquo; she explained, bringing her voice to a whisper. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been really worried about you overworking yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke&rsquo;s eyes went wide in surprise. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s&hellip; worried about me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Bethany replied gently. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you should take a break sometimes. We all need rest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke considered her words with a thoughtful expression. She just didn&rsquo;t understand Rosalind. She knew the noblewoman was nice, but why was she so concerned about a simple knight?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke sighed. She couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to think any further. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For now, she was going to accept Rosalind&rsquo;s kindness. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She turned to Bethany with a grateful smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tell Lady Rosalind I said&hellip; thank you,&rdquo; she muttered shyly. </span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Later that evening, after Silke had returned to her quarters and eaten a warm meal, Rosalind found her on the terrace, gazing out into the starry night. Silke turned as Rosalind approached, a hint of wariness in her eyes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Evening, Silke,&rdquo; Rosalind began. &ldquo;How has your life been thus far?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silke forced a smile. &ldquo;The manor is wonderful. I&rsquo;m grateful for your kindness, my lady.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice to hear,&rdquo; she said genuinely. &ldquo;Now, I was debating whether I should ask this, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it, my lady?&rdquo; Silke asked curiously.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s face grew serious. &ldquo;I have a task for you,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;A very important task.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silke&rsquo;s hand instinctively went to her sword, thinking of her prior vision and its terrible imagery. She steeled herself. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What would you have me do, my lady?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so tense,&rdquo; Rosalind chuckled. &ldquo;This is a request you will appreciate.&rdquo; She held out a small document, one that bore a familiar seal.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silke took the document, studying it for a few seconds before staring incredulously. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be serious&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Rosalind nodded. &ldquo;I want you to sneak into the Assassin&rsquo;s Guild to find evidence of their wrongdoings. Preferably, some documents that implicate potential members.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silke stared at her, searching for some sort of catch. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she said confusedly. &ldquo;This wouldn&rsquo;t benefit you at all, my lady.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, but it does,&rdquo; Rosalind said, shaking her head. &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;m trying to tie up loose ends, to get rid of the remnants of my past. And I want to prevent the guild from being used ever again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But there are no benefits for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, but there are plenty for you, Silke.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silke didn&rsquo;t know what to think of Rosalind&rsquo;s words, but they certainly resonated. She hated the guild more than anyone, and now someone was willing to fulfill her hatred. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why are you helping me, my lady?&rdquo; Silke looked to the ground. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just an orphan nobody loves. It would be better if you just never associated with me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want that, Silke,&rdquo; Rosalind said with a smile. &ldquo;I saved you for a reason.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What reason?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because we&rsquo;re the same,&rdquo; Rosalind explained simply. &ldquo;We both desired things we couldn&rsquo;t have.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke&rsquo;s hands trembled slightly as she held the document. She still recalled the haunting images of that vision, but when she considered everything Lady Rosalind had done for her, those worries seemed trivial. It was only a dream, a terrifying one, but just a dream. And now, she had the chance to take down those who had imprisoned her once before. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a deep breath, Silke straightened, meeting Rosalind&rsquo;s gaze with newfound resolve.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;My lady,&quot; she said softly, her voice steadying with each word, &quot;I pledge myself to you, as your honorable knight in arms. Whatever you ask, however dangerous or daunting, impossible or unreachable&hellip; I will serve you with everything I am.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s eyes widened slightly, her expression softened by a mixture of surprise and approval. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Are you sure of this decision, Silke?&quot; Rosalind&rsquo;s voice held a note of genuine concern. &quot;This is no easy task, by any means. Even I think it&rsquo;s nearly impossible under current circumstances.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke shook her head, confidence growing within her as she took in Rosalind&rsquo;s worries. &quot;I am certain, my lady. If it means protecting you and aiding your mission, then my life is yours.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s gaze lingered on Silke, a strange flicker of emotion dancing in her eyes. After a moment, she placed a gentle hand on Silke&rsquo;s shoulder. &quot;I am grateful for your loyalty, Silke.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Rosalind withdrew her hand, she continued, her tone taking on a note of caution. &ldquo;But please be careful. Those documents will undoubtedly be heavily guarded. If the situation seems truly dire, don&rsquo;t hesitate to return here. Your safety is more important to me than any document.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke nodded, absorbing every word. &quot;I will not fail you, Lady Rosalind.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c22" id="h.akotyawdesh7"><span class="c18">Chapter 12 - Close And Closer</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind Harcourt was never flustered by anything. At least, that&rsquo;s what the general populace believed. She was a confident villainess, so why should she show fear or be surprised? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, it seemed this belief was not entirely correct. A monsoon had just blown through the Harcourt Estate one brisk morning, and not the &ldquo;deadly storm&rdquo; kind. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Throughout Rosalind&rsquo;s bedroom, dresses, accessories, and hats of all kinds were scattered about, and in the midst of all, Rosalind was looking frantic. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bethany, do you think this one is too much?&rdquo; Rosalind asked, eyeing herself in the mirror as she flipped between two wide-brimmed sun hats. &ldquo;Or is this one a little less egregious?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bethany stifled a laugh. &ldquo;Both look great on you, my lady.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t just choose anything!&rdquo; Rosalind exclaimed, both hats exchanging places on her head in her distress. &ldquo;The color on this one doesn&rsquo;t work with the dress&hellip; but this other one is too flowy!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bethany watched her, an amused smile tugging at her lips. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you this flustered about dressing up in quite a while.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Everything must be perfect!&rdquo; Rosalind snapped. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have Eliza being ridiculed because of her foolish older sister. It would be blasphemous!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bethany shook her head. They had been going through this back and forth for what seemed like hours, as for the first time in a long while, Rosalind was taking Eliza out on a playdate. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No business, no deliberate evil schemes, not even any goals of repentance. Rosalind was simply eager to jump at this opportunity, if not for respite it would bring, then for the chance to make up for all the time she lost with her beloved little sister. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eventually, Rosalind appeared from her bedroom, having prepared as best she could, despite her further apprehensions. She found Silke waiting for her at the door, a small smile tugging at her lips. &ldquo;Good morning, my lady.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Morning, Silke,&rdquo; Rosalind replied, adjusting her gloves. &ldquo;Any news?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke nodded, her usual reserved expression softening just slightly. She leaned in and dropped her voice to a whisper. &ldquo;The last remnants of the Assassin&rsquo;s Guild have been dealt with.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s eyes widened for a brief moment before a smile spread across her face. &ldquo;Then the investigation is progressing well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke dipped her head, a glimmer of pride in her gaze. &ldquo;Your testimony was helpful, my lady,&rdquo; she said with a bow. &ldquo;Thank you for giving me this opportunity&hellip; I can finally sleep knowing they faced justice for what they did to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind gently touched Silke&rsquo;s shoulder, giving her a kind smile. &ldquo;It was the least I could do for you, Silke,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;You deserve every bit of that justice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For the first time since they met, a wide smile formed on Silke&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Thank you, my lady,&rdquo; she said gratefully. &ldquo;I promise to always serve you well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind nodded. They made their way to the entrance hall, where Eliza was waiting, a bundle of excitement barely contained in her small frame.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rose! Rose!&rdquo; Eliza&rsquo;s voice was bright as she ran over and tugged at Rosalind&rsquo;s sleeve. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going out today, right? You promised me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind laughed, ruffling her little sister&rsquo;s soft hair. &ldquo;Yes, you little ball of cuteness. I wouldn&rsquo;t miss this for the world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they settled into the carriage, Eliza&rsquo;s gaze lingered on Rosalind, noticing her joyful expression. &quot;You look so happy today,&quot; she noted, tilting her head to the side with a curious smile. &quot;Did something happen?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind smiled brightly. &quot;Of course. I just received some wonderful news,&quot; she said, a warm expression on her face, &quot;and I&rsquo;m spending the day with you. What&rsquo;s not to be happy about?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eliza beamed, her grin infectious. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad! I really missed you. I hated how distant you were!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s smile faltered for a moment, but she took her sister&rsquo;s hand, squeezing it gently. &quot;I&rsquo;m sorry, Eliza. I know I&rsquo;ve been distracted, but I promise you&rsquo;ll always have my time. You&rsquo;re the most important part of my life.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eliza&rsquo;s smile also faltered, sensing the shift in the atmosphere. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be so serious about it, Rose,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just glad you haven&rsquo;t forgotten about me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind was overcome with emotion, hugging Eliza tightly to mask her tears. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget about you, Eliza,&rdquo; she whispered, thinking of her previous life. &ldquo;If that day ever comes&hellip; I&rsquo;ll never forgive myself.&rdquo; </span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind and Eliza exchanged jovial words as their carriage rolled through the streets of the capital. The brief moment of solemnity that had happened between them a few minutes earlier seemed like a minor footnote, passing as quickly as it occurred. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their first stop was a candy shop that Rosalind knew Eliza adored. The moment they stepped inside, Eliza&rsquo;s eyes lit up. Rosalind could barely keep track of her, choosing to watch from afar in amusement at her cheerful expressions. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the end, they left with two large jars of candy in hand. Of course, such products weren&rsquo;t cheap, but why Rosalind hesitate to buy something that makes her little sister happy?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Silke,&rdquo; Rosalind turned to Silke who was following them. &ldquo;Could you take these to the carriage?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course, my lady.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke took the jars, carrying them back to the carriage while Rosalind and Eliza continued to explore. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Next, they visited a clothing store, where they tried on dresses, gloves, hats, scarves, and any other items they could get their hands on. Rosalind was particularly keen on a pair of tiny, pastel-colored gloves that fit Eliza perfectly. For just a moment, all her past mistakes and regrets were forgotten. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, they arrived at a large toy store, where Rosalind bought her little sister a plush cat with fur as soft as clouds. Eliza held it close with a bright, sparkling smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll name her Rosy, after you!&rdquo; she declared, squeezing the plush cat tightly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s heart melted, and she smiled. If she could control time, she would have certainly wanted to be in this moment for as long as possible. &ldquo;Rosy? I think it&rsquo;s a perfect name.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they were leaving the toy store, Rosalind spotted a familiar figure up ahead on the sidewalk. Rosalind&rsquo;s heart nearly skipped a beat when she recognized him: Francis. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She hadn&rsquo;t yet asked him to tea, for reasons she couldn&rsquo;t quite explain. Perhaps she was afraid of getting close to someone like him. Or she could have simply been shy. After all, when was the last time she invited a man to personal tea time?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Rosalind debated whether she should call out to him, Francis turned on his heel, his eyes going wide upon seeing her. &ldquo;Rosalind,&rdquo; he greeted, his face bright. &ldquo;This is a pleasant surprise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;D-Duke Francis&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind stuttered, flustered. Her cheeks flushed a delicate shade of pink, something Eliza noticed immediately. &ldquo;What brings you into town? And without guards, no less?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis smiled. &ldquo;I was just observing some of my local investments,&rdquo; he explained. He noticed Eliza and leaned down to face her. &ldquo;And you must be Lady Eliza. Rosalind told me all about you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eliza eyed him curiously. &ldquo;Who are you, mister?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m one of Rosalind&rsquo;s trusted friends. You can just call me Duke Francis.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eliza&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. &ldquo;A trusted friend?&rdquo; she glanced between him and her sister. &ldquo;How do I know you won&rsquo;t hurt her like everyone else?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis frowned. &ldquo;I would never dream of such a thing,&rdquo; he assured. &ldquo;I really do care about your sister.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind turned away, hiding the warmth that was filling her face. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t assume things, Eliza&hellip;&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;I trust Francis.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that, Rosalind,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;Since we&rsquo;re all here, why don&rsquo;t we have a meal? I&rsquo;ll treat you both to lunch.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind hesitated. Some part of her brain objected to the idea, telling her that she shouldn&rsquo;t get too close to him. She still remembered the last time she allowed herself to be enveloped by affection. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But even then, this was only a simple invite to lunch, so why did she feel this way? She didn&rsquo;t love Francis, did she? No, of course not. Rosalind shook her head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That sounds like a w-wonderful idea,&rdquo; Rosalind said, stuttering slightly, a faint blush still visible on her face. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis held out his hand. &ldquo;Then let us be off,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;I know just the place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Rosalind nervously took his hand, Eliza glanced between them, realization dawning in her mind. A sneaky grin formed on her face. </span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind and Eliza found themselves seated inside a fancy restaurant that was well known throughout the country for its elegant decor and delicious pastries. They ordered a selection of tea and treats, the conversation flowing between the three of them easily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve yet to invite me to tea, Rosalind,&rdquo; Francis said teasingly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My apologies,&rdquo; said Rosalind, feeling somewhat guilty. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m not bold enough to freely send personal letters to male friends&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to apologize,&rdquo; Francis said with a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for your letters for as long as you want me to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind smiled as she bit into a pastry. Why did his words make her feel so happy inside? Why was he so conscious of her? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you, Francis.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis noticed Rosalind&rsquo;s smile and couldn&rsquo;t help but comment. &ldquo;Rosalind, you seem&hellip; lighter today,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see you so at ease since the party.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s eyes met his, and she felt her pulse quicken. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a good day so far,&rdquo; she replied softly. &ldquo;And&hellip; I received some wonderful news this morning. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re also aware?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Francis nodded. &ldquo;Your involvement in the Assassin&rsquo;s Guild case was extremely notable. You&rsquo;ve shown yourself to be an impressive heir, Rosalind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s heart swelled at his words, a rare warmth spreading through her. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have done it alone,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;My family and&hellip; loyal friends made it possible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eliza&rsquo;s eyes darted back and forth between them, a mischievous glint in her gaze. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rose,&rdquo; she said slyly, leaning over to Rosalind, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so friendly with each other, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind coughed, nearly spilling her tea. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re so alike!&rdquo; she defended. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just friends.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Friends?&rdquo; Eliza stared at her intently. &ldquo;But you and Francis look so nice together.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind coughed again, this time more violent than the last. &ldquo;Eliza!&rdquo; she hissed, though the pink flush on her cheeks darkened. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis chuckled, seemingly unfazed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m honored you think so, Eliza,&rdquo; he replied, meeting Rosalind&rsquo;s gaze with a knowing look. &ldquo;I hope I can live up to that compliment.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eliza&rsquo;s gaze flickered knowingly between the two, sensing the growing bond between them. She leaned in close to Silke, who had been watching intently from a distance and whispered, &ldquo;Silke, let&rsquo;s sneak out of here. I think Rosalind would enjoy some time alone with Francis.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke&rsquo;s brow furrowed, glancing toward Rosalind. &ldquo;Lady Eliza, my duty is to protect your sister at all times&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Trust me,&rdquo; Eliza said with a wink, grabbing Silke&rsquo;s hand and tugging her out of the restaurant before she could protest further. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Noticing the two were gone, Rosalind glanced at Francis, feeling both flustered and surprisingly relieved. &ldquo;I apologize for my sister&rsquo;s behavior. She&rsquo;s always been a bit&hellip; excitable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis smiled. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to apologize for. She&rsquo;s a lovely little girl.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A comfortable silence settled between them. As much as she wanted to deny it, Rosalind knew she was becoming accustomed to Francis&rsquo; presence. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How could she not like someone kind like him? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But she was scared to admit that officially, to say anything recklessly that might end their relationship. She didn&rsquo;t want to lose him because of a random whim. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there was also one other nagging element that made things difficult. As much as she didn&rsquo;t want to broach the subject, she was too curious not to ask. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Francis&hellip;&rdquo; she started hesitantly. &ldquo;Before, you mentioned there was a lady you liked&hellip; do you still like her, even now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis&rsquo; expression softened, his gaze unwavering. &ldquo;Yes. Very much.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s heart sank, but she forced herself to nod with a smile. &ldquo;I hope you find happiness with her.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16 c17">Love really is the worst feeling&hellip;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind couldn&rsquo;t explain it, but hearing those words hurt more than even Prince Vicente&rsquo;s denial of her feelings all those years ago. Why was she so susceptible to love? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind wanted to pull Francis by the collar and tell him how upset his words made her, but she couldn&rsquo;t. She was scared, and now for the first time in her life, she felt insecure. Who was this lady he loved even though she forgot his existence? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How could he love someone so much? What made someone so worth loving to that extent?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you alright, Rosalind?&rdquo; Francis asked, noticing her palpable silence. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Rosalind lied. &ldquo;I was just&hellip; thinking about something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Francis nodded. &ldquo;We should probably go find your sister, shouldn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind nodded silently. They both stood up from the table, but in the spur of the moment, Rosalind grabbed Francis by the hand. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um, Francis&hellip;&rdquo; she started nervously. &ldquo;I want to have tea soon. And an exchange of letters&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to rush,&rdquo; Francis assured her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Rosalind exclaimed, a little more forcefully than she intended. &ldquo;I&hellip; I want to get to know you better. Please?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis smiled. &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they left the restaurant, Rosalind found the carriage awaiting her at the edge of the street. Eliza and Silke were already seated inside, sharing whispers amongst each other. Rosalind climbed in beside her sister, stealing one last glance at Francis before closing the door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The city faded behind them, but Rosalind&rsquo;s thoughts lingered on him. She thought about his kind smile, the warmth in his voice, and the strange new feelings that had begun to bloom in her heart. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind wasn&rsquo;t certain if she could embrace the scary discontent that was engulfing her, but a small part of her was willing to try, willing to hope that maybe, just maybe, love wasn&rsquo;t a terrible thing after all. </span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c22" id="h.sa3x07517y7"><span class="c18">Chapter 13 - The Great Miracle</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The annual tea party hosted by the saint was a celebration of the country&rsquo;s women, and their honorable achievements. Established in the past by a prior empress, the event meant for women was celebrated by all. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For some, it was an opportunity to make connections with women of influence. For others, it was simply a chance to make friends with fellow women and celebrate the nature of femininity. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind stood on the periphery of the gathering, her gaze drifting over the crowd, a mixture of faces both familiar and foreign to her. She locked eyes with Melody, who was surrounded by a mob of noblewomen eager to talk with her. Finding an opportunity, she managed to excuse herself and walked over to Rosalind with a weary smile. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You look tired,&rdquo; Rosalind teased gently, a playful sparkle in her eye. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Melody groaned, grabbing a glass of wine from a nearby table. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so hard being popular, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They sat talking for a while, enjoying each other&rsquo;s presence. Their conversation was a mix of business, personal events, and general subjects. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;On another note,&rdquo; Melody started with a grin, &ldquo;Have you invited Francis to tea yet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind choked on her wine, coughing violently with a blush. &ldquo;W-we&rsquo;ve exchanged letters!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I must say, this side of you is quite amusing,&rdquo; Melody laughed. &ldquo;Who would have thought the infamous Rosalind could be so easily flustered?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; I&rsquo;m not flustered&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind mumbled, averting her gaze. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As their playful banter continued, they began to feel a sudden shift in the atmosphere. Subtle murmurs and whispers rippled through the crowd, easily reaching their ears.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Lady Rosalind and Lady Melody are laughing together?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;I thought they were bitter rivals?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Has Lady Rosalind truly changed for the better?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;How could the honorable Lady Melody associate with that villainess? I don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s changed at all!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody rolled her eyes. &ldquo;They just don&rsquo;t stop whispering, do they?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Rosalind nodded with a sigh. &ldquo;If they want to talk so much, why don&rsquo;t they ever do it to our faces?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You feel the same way?&rdquo; Melody snorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not alone in this matter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They laughed together, ignoring the whispers and gossip around them. At some point, one face amongst the crowd drew Rosalind&rsquo;s attention, sitting alone at a table with a despondent expression. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A blip of realization filled her face, and she frowned. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lady Beatrice&hellip;&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;No one wants to sit with her?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody followed her gaze with a sip of wine and frowned. &ldquo;You know how these people are,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;They still haven&rsquo;t gotten over that incident at her debut party.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind stared at her sadly. &ldquo;My terrible past has reared its ugly head once again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; Melody turned to stare at her in surprise. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you were the one who released all those monsters?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind nodded guiltily. &ldquo;It was a mistake,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;Lady Marciella was there, and I&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Melody nodded in understanding. &ldquo;How jealous were you, seriously? I&rsquo;m still having trouble believing that was you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I regret it,&rdquo; Rosalind said, looking to the ground. &ldquo;I should go apologize.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She placed down her wine glass and made her way through the crowd towards Beatrice. Lady Beatrice looked up, her eyes widening in surprise as Rosalind approached and offered a polite bow. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lady Beatrice&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind said gently. &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Beatrice met her gaze with a haunted look. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m aimless,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;Ever since my terrible debut&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A murmur broke out around them as other noblewomen nearby overheard. One woman shook her head disapprovingly. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh dear. Don&rsquo;t bring up such a dreadful event at this lovely party!&rdquo; the woman whispered, though her words carried clearly across the venue. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Another noblewoman, her fan fluttering in front of her face, added, &ldquo;Is Beatrice causing a commotion again?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She always was such a stain on her family&rsquo;s good name,&rdquo; a third noblewoman muttered darkly, her gaze cold. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I still have nightmares about that incident!&rdquo; another woman hissed. The whispers swirled around Beatrice, echoing the choices of a past Rosalind knew she had orchestrated. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ladies,&rdquo; she started, frowning. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding I deliberately caused.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind rose from her chair, bowing deeply to Beatrice, her eyes filled with remorse. The surrounding noblewoman fell silent, looking at her in shocked confusion. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am so, so sorry, Lady Beatrice,&rdquo; Rosalind said guiltily. &ldquo;That whole affair was of my own making. I wish I never had to force you to take the fall for it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Beatrice&rsquo;s eyes widened in disbelief, her voice barely a whisper. &ldquo;You mean to say&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was foolish then,&rdquo; Rosalind admitted, her voice thick with guilt. &ldquo;I hired someone to bring in a few small monsters. It was only meant to scare Lady Marciella. But in my jealousy, I failed to consider the consequences&mdash;and I also hurt you in the process.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At these words, a fresh wave of whispers swept through the noblewomen surrounding them. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;So that whole incident was because of Rosalind?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;The villainess was behind it all&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;But why would she admit it now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The silence stretched as Rosalind held Beatrice&rsquo;s gaze, sincerity shining in her eyes. Beatrice looked at her, seemingly torn between anger and understanding of the vulnerability Rosalind exhibited.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lady Rosalind,&rdquo; she started slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pretend you never said that. Even if those events were yours, I still allowed them to happen. I deserve the criticism.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind shook her head. &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t. You are a person with bold aspirations, Beatrice. Aspirations that I ruined out of petty jealousness.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Beatrice hesitated, then sighed. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not brave enough,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I admire your confidence, Lady Rosalind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s expression softened as she sat down beside her, placing a gentle hand on her shoulder. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You should have more confidence in yourself, Lady Beatrice,&rdquo; she said, smiling kindly. &ldquo;You have the power to shape your own life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Beatrice looked up at her, hopeful. &ldquo;Am I&hellip; really allowed to be happy?&rdquo; she asked, a faint light in her eyes. &ldquo;Even though my sisters are always shining so brightly?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Rosalind said with a nod. &ldquo;All you have to do is take the first step. Fate doesn&rsquo;t write itself, after all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A tear slipped down Bethany&rsquo;s cheek as she looked up at Rosalind, her shoulders relaxing as if a weight had finally been lifted. &ldquo;But&hellip; why are you helping me, after everything?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind&#39;s smile grew wistful. &ldquo;Because I want you to show me, Beatrice,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;I want you to show me that you can rise above the hurt I caused you. I want to see you fulfill your aspirations. I want to see you from afar and be able to say &lsquo;what a powerful woman&rsquo; with a feeling of pride.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s powerful words left all in silence. Melody walked over to them and sat at their table with a look of astonishment. &ldquo;You certainly have a way with words,&rdquo; she said in admiration. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; Rosalind grinned. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know who I am?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Beatrice glanced between them nervously, their combined aura overwhelming her. &ldquo;L-Lady Melody,&rdquo; she started slowly, &ldquo;W-what brings you here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to help, of course,&rdquo; Melody said with a smile. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we have a chat?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For the rest of the tea party, Rosalind and Melody sat beside Beatrice, sharing quiet conversation and soft words of encouragement. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the tea party came to an end, Rosalind took her leave of Beatrice and Melody, who both returned her parting smile with nods. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But as she stepped through the archway, a figure blocked her path&mdash;a woman dressed in simple but elegant robes, her serene face seemingly encased in light. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The saint. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; the saint began, her gaze fixed intently upon Rosalind. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind halted, surprised. &ldquo;Yes, my lady?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The saint&rsquo;s eyes narrowed, studying her with an intensity that sent a shiver down Rosalind&rsquo;s spine. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an unusual one, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind blinked, caught off guard. &ldquo;Pardon me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know who I am, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the saint asked, her voice soft but commanding. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re the saint,&rdquo; Rosalind replied, nodding respectfully.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The saint made a small, thoughtful hum, her gaze never leaving Rosalind. &ldquo;Yes, yes, I can see it now,&rdquo; she said cryptically. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve already lived one existence before, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind froze. Had she been discovered? A feeling of fear engulfed her as she slowly considered her next move and choice of words. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know what you mean&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind stuttered. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your soul is far older than it ought to be in this life,&rdquo; the saint said, furrowing her brow. &ldquo;Tell me, Rosalind Harcourt&mdash;how old are you currently?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A tremor ran through Rosalind as she met the saint&rsquo;s penetrating gaze. &ldquo;Sixteen&hellip; I&rsquo;m sixteen years old.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; the saint nodded thoughtfully. &ldquo;And yet&hellip; your soul is aged nearly 36 years. You&rsquo;re living two lives in this one singular life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s heart pounded as the saint&rsquo;s words sank in. She struggled to find words to say in response. &ldquo;How&hellip; how could you possibly know that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The saint&rsquo;s eyes softened, filled with a strange curiosity and sympathy. &ldquo;As the gods&rsquo; chosen one, I see many things others cannot,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;In this case, I can see that time has been bent for your sake, Rosalind. But why is that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind shook her head. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;It just&hellip; happened.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It just happened?&rdquo; the saint repeated with a tilt of her head. She noticed Rosalind&rsquo;s bracelet and her eyes went wide. &ldquo;That bracelet of yours&hellip; where did it come from?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It was a gift from an old friend,&rdquo; Rosalind explained, confused by the question. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A gift?&rdquo; the saint asked, nodding thoughtfully. She took Rosalind&rsquo;s hand and studied the bracelet carefully. &ldquo;Then I believe there&rsquo;s an answer to all of this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind tilted her head. &ldquo;An answer?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;On rare occasions, when the right conditions are fulfilled, the world deposes on us humans a miracle,&rdquo; the saint explained. &ldquo;Sometimes this results in good luck, or other times it can change the very threads of fate. The most common of these miracles can happen when a gift is bestowed with sincere intentions.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She looked up at Rosalind. &ldquo;Whoever gave you that gift, gave you a miracle. I presume that miracle was time itself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A miracle&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind whispered, her fingers lightly brushing against the beaded bracelet. &ldquo;But who would have granted me such a thing? The gods?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The saint smiled, and she laid a gentle hand on Rosalind&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;The gods do not intervene in our lives so directly. Miracles happen spontaneously, often without rhyme or reason, by those who love deeply. Perhaps, Rosalind, someone in your past&mdash;someone who cared about you&mdash;left you this gift. Does anyone come to mind?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s eyes misted as a familiar face drifted into her mind&mdash;a boy with dark hair, kind eyes, </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A boy named Fran,&rdquo; she murmured with a smile. </span></p><h2 class="c22" id="h.i9v0neyftevb"><span class="c18">Chapter 14 - Heart-Pounding Familiarity</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind took a deep breath as she peered out the windows of her family&rsquo;s carriage. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What she was about to do required more confidence than anything she had ever done before. She patted down her dress and checked her hair, trying to buy time. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Steeling herself, she slowly opened the door. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seemed that as soon she peeked her head out of the carriage, her feelings of nervousness increased ten-fold. There Francis stood, waiting for her with his hand outstretched. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Welcome,&rdquo; he said with a smile. &ldquo;I trust your trip here was comfortable?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your estate was hard to find,&rdquo; Rosalind said, taking his hand shyly, descending the stairs slowly. &ldquo;But the ride was indeed pleasant.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleased to hear that,&rdquo; Francis responded, wrapping an arm around one of her own. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see you, Rosalind. Though I must say, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting you to invite me to my own estate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Rosalind said sheepishly. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Francis assured. His eyes twinkled with mischief as he added, &ldquo;Just&hellip; be prepared.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Be prepared for what?&rdquo; Rosalind asked curiously. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francis gave her a cryptic smile. &ldquo;&hellip;you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The grand mansion loomed ahead, its stately architecture framed by manicured gardens and ornate fountains. But Rosalind was barely able to appreciate any of it, because as soon as they walked through the gates, the entire staff froze. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Everyone stared at them with wide eyes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Duke Francis has brought home a lady?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a miracle!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;We better start preparing for rain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind was a bit surprised. &ldquo;Um&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis sighed, running a hand through his hair as a faint flush dusted his cheeks. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re&hellip; a bit obsessed,&rdquo; he admitted, scratching the back of his neck awkwardly. &ldquo;You see, they&rsquo;ve always been concerned about my wellbeing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Concerned?&rdquo; Rosalind echoed, her voice tinged with disbelief as she glanced at the group of servants who were whispering eagerly amongst themselves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Francis replied with a resigned shrug. &ldquo;Apparently, my lack of&hellip; romantic partners has been a topic of endless worry.&rdquo; He gave Rosalind a wry smile. &ldquo;They must have believed I would spend the rest of my life alone.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Rosalind said, still processing the unexpected attention. Her gaze flicked to the staff again, noting how several maids were glancing her way with wide, hopeful eyes, as if silently willing her to be their duke&rsquo;s savior. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a bit&hellip; overwhelming.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Francis said, laughing softly. &ldquo;But they mean well. They&rsquo;ve been like family to me, in their own way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The murmurs of the staff grew louder as the pair moved closer to the grand entrance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Such elegance,&rdquo; a maid whispered, her eyes sparkling with admiration. &ldquo;I wonder where he met her?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;s the one?&rdquo; another chimed in excitedly, her hands clasped together as if in prayer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind shot Francis a panicked glance, her cheeks flaming red. &ldquo;Francis!&rdquo; she hissed under her breath. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re getting the wrong idea!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware,&rdquo; Francis replied, his voice calm but tinged with amusement. He leaned slightly closer, his tone dropping conspiratorially. &ldquo;But can you really blame them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If this keeps up, I&rsquo;m going to run away,&rdquo; Rosalind muttered, half-joking, her eyes darting to the path behind them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis grinned, clearly enjoying her flustered state. &ldquo;Relax. I&rsquo;ll clear things up later.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16">&ldquo;</span><span class="c16 c17">Later?</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; Rosalind echoed, incredulous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before she could press the matter further, the doors to the mansion swung open, revealing an elderly man with an air of authority and refinement.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Evening, your grace,&rdquo; he said with a bow. &ldquo;And this is&hellip; Lady Rosalind, I presume?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Greetings,&rdquo; Rosalind said, bracing for a reaction. &ldquo;I hope my presence isn&rsquo;t a bother to your work?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; the butler shook his head. &ldquo;It brings me great pride to see the young master taking care of his legacy.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s head fell in her hands as she groaned. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Walter,&rdquo; Francis started with an exasperated look, &ldquo;Could you tell the other servants not to get carried away?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s too late for that, your grace,&rdquo; the butler said with an amused smile. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve already begun.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well then tell them not to go overboard,&rdquo; Francis said, shaking his head. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If I can manage,&rdquo; the butler said with a knowing look. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis led Rosalind through the halls of his manor, showcasing its ornate fixtures and collected treasures. Rosalind was in awe of the grand scale of everything, but she also strangely felt that she had seen it all before. But why was that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was her first time here, so why was she struck with this strange feeling of familiarity?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her thoughts drifted until her gaze caught on something outside&mdash;a sprawling garden that stretched far into the distance. One section, in particular, drew her attention: a field awash in deep purple hues.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is that&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind murmured, trailing off as her steps slowed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis followed her gaze, his smile softening &ldquo;Do you wish to see the garden?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without hesitation, Rosalind nodded. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d love to.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they approached the garden, Rosalind gasped softly. The field before her was a never ending sea of lavender, the blooms swaying gently in the breeze. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lavender&hellip;&rdquo; she muttered, her fingers brushing against the delicate petals. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been growing them,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Just in case you were here. They&rsquo;re your favorite, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind started, &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t normally tell people about that&hellip; how do you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis&rsquo;s smile didn&rsquo;t waver, though his tone carried a hint of mystery. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter, does it? Word gets around fast in this country.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Rosalind nodded, brushing off his comment. Though, she couldn&rsquo;t deny that even this field looked somewhat familiar to her&hellip;</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis and Rosalind returned to the mansion&rsquo;s interior, their steps echoing throughout the halls. As they moved from one room to the next, Rosalind&rsquo;s unease grew. She felt more and more confident in her feeling that this was all familiar. But why? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How could she recognize sights from someone else&rsquo;s home?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have something special to show you,&rdquo; Francis said suddenly, breaking the silence. His voice was warm, yet there was a curious edge to it that Rosalind couldn&rsquo;t quite place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He led her to the end of a long corridor, stopping in front of an ornate painting framed in gilded wood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind began, tilting her head to take in the image.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My family,&rdquo; Francis said. &ldquo;These are my brothers, my mother, and my father.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You have brothers?&rdquo; Rosalind asked, her tone laced with curiosity as her gaze lingered on the faces in the painting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Francis replied, his smile tinged with melancholy. &ldquo;But they&rsquo;re all far away now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Far away?&rdquo; Rosalind repeated curiously. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;When I became the heir to the family,&rdquo; Francis explained. &ldquo;My brothers were always competing with me. So I had to become strong enough to overpower them and send them away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You exiled them?&rdquo; Rosalind asked in surprise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I gave them money and job applications so they could live their own lives away from me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind frowned. &ldquo;But&hellip; wouldn&rsquo;t it have been easier to&hellip; kill them?&rdquo; she asked hesitantly, the blunt words harsh on her tongue. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Definitely,&rdquo; Francis nodded. &ldquo;But they&rsquo;re my brothers. Even for the title of heir, I couldn&rsquo;t possibly harm my family. Even the great villainess Rosalind still loved her family, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind opened her mouth to speak, but the words wouldn&rsquo;t come. There was something about his words, his tone, that made her feel as if he knew the events of the past. Why would he word the question like that? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said finally. &ldquo;I could never hurt my family.&rdquo;</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Passing by the dining room, Rosalind and Francis were suddenly greeted by two maids. &ldquo;Duke Francis, Lady Rosalind,&rdquo; they started with bows, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve prepared something for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask for any preparations&hellip;&rdquo; Francis said, raising an eyebrow. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We insist,&rdquo; the other maid said, a mischievous glint in her eye. Before either could protest, the maids gently but firmly guided them into the dining hall. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Inside, they were greeted by several maids and butlers who were standing regally. Behind them, the dining table was filled with all kinds of fancy dishes, most of them using rare ingredients. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind eyed the ornate dining table, feeling like she was at a feast fit for a king. &ldquo;I thought we were just having tea?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So did I&hellip;&rdquo; Francis glanced at the servants, who maintained their regal forms without flinching. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Today is cause for celebration, Duke Francis,&rdquo; one of the maids said. &ldquo;You must have dinner together.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis sighed, running a hand through his hair. &ldquo;It seems we have no choice. Shall we?&rdquo; he said, gesturing to the table with a resigned smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind nodded. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind having dinner,&rdquo; she muttered, looking away from him with a blush. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They took their seats, the soft clink of silverware punctuating the air as they began their meal. Conversation flowed naturally at first&mdash;lighthearted and polite&mdash;but Rosalind&rsquo;s thoughts kept circling back to her strange sense of familiarity with the mansion.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know, this place feels awfully familiar to me,&rdquo; Rosalind said as she bit off her fork. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Perhaps you had been here in a previous life,&rdquo; Francis said cryptically. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind eyed him curiously with suspicion. &ldquo;A previous life?&rdquo; she repeated. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe in previous lives?&rdquo; Francis asked with a smile. &ldquo;They say we can see our prior lives in our dreams.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind thought back to her own previous life and frowned. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it does any good to dwell on the past.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fair enough,&rdquo; Francis said, nodding. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Their conversations continued as normal, though there was now a hint of strangeness to everything that Rosalind couldn&rsquo;t ignore. Why had he mentioned previous lives? Could he potentially know something? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re able to talk like this, Rosalind,&rdquo; Francis said wistfully, after a while. &ldquo;Even at the end, you were always so far away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind froze, her fork clinking against her plate. &ldquo;At the end?&rdquo; she echoed, her eyes narrowing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, it&#39;s nothing,&rdquo; Francis said quickly, &ldquo;Just a slip of the tongue.&rdquo;</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, they found themselves in Francis&rsquo; study, where they drank tea together. It was the true purpose of their meeting, but they had completely forgotten about it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Francis,&rdquo; Rosalind started hesitantly. &ldquo;Today has been wonderful.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve enjoyed having you, Rosalind.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve enjoyed being here. However, I&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind struggled to think of words. &ldquo;I want to tell you something important. Regarding&hellip; us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Francis said with a smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind was almost sweating in her nervousness. &ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m not good at admitting these things&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis chuckled and reached behind his desk, pulling out a bottle of wine. &ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t we have a drink?&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;You might do well with some liquid confidence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a dangerous suggestion, Francis.&rdquo; Rosalind said, though she was already calling one of his maids for glasses by the time she finished her sentence. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tea cups were exchanged for wine glasses, and the teapot was exchanged for the perfectly aged wine. By eight drinks, they were already feeling the effects. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This stuff is so rich&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind slurred. &ldquo;I feel like I can say anything.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Careful,&rdquo; Francis said playfully, also slurring his words. &ldquo;Speaking your mind can be deadly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But I want to speak!&rdquo; Rosalind exclaimed. &ldquo;Because I like you, Francis. Why can I never say that? I&rsquo;m so stupidly shy, aren&rsquo;t I? Do you think I could say it, Francis?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis chuckled. &ldquo;You just did.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Rosalind cried. &ldquo;This stuff is dangerous!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It sure is,&rdquo; Francis laughed. &ldquo;I might just tell you things you aren&rsquo;t supposed to know.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then tell me this!&rdquo; Rosalind exclaimed, her voice wobbly. &ldquo;Why do you know so much about me? Why do you act so cryptic, yet make reference to events that didn&rsquo;t happen?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because we are alike, Rosalind,&rdquo; Francis said, caressing her hair, which caused her to blush. &ldquo;We both have seen a terrible future. The only difference is, you&rsquo;ve worked against that fate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So you&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind shook, almost sobering up in the face of this shocking truth. &ldquo;You know about my past life? You know that I died, that my entire family was killed in front of me? You know time was reversed?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. My plan was to try and save you, but you went beyond my expectations. I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d work so hard to repent.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; Rosalind asked sadly. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t want you to suffer in knowing,&rdquo; said Francis simply. &ldquo;But I guess you know now. This stuff really keeps you talking.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind frowned. &ldquo;So then&hellip;&rdquo; she looked to the ground. &ldquo;Why do you care so much for me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francis grabbed her wrist, holding up her bracelet. &ldquo;Do you remember who gave you this bracelet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It was from an old friend I barely remember,&rdquo; Rosalind said confused. &ldquo;But why is that important right now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then do you remember the name &lsquo;Fran&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? How do you&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was the boy who gave you that bracelet,&rdquo; said Francis with a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been thinking about you, from the moment we met. When I heard that you died, I was heartbroken. The truth is, I knew you loved Prince Vicente, so I tried to stay away from you, for your own good. But in this life&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You approached me in the garden.&rdquo; Rosalind said, smiling through her tears. &ldquo;How could I have forgotten you, Fran?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She hugged him, partially influenced by the wine, but also overcome with emotion. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No wonder this place was so familiar,&rdquo; Rosalind cried. &ldquo;I played here all the time, with you and Melody!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francis frowned. &ldquo;You know&hellip;&rdquo; he started hesitantly. &ldquo;Melody was really hurt when she heard of your death. I remember her crying in my arms&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind placed a finger on his lips. &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear about the past anymore. Me and Melody have made up in this life, so that time is over.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c16">&ldquo;So what </span><span class="c16 c17">do</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;you want to hear?&rdquo; Francis asked slyly. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind blushed. &ldquo;I want to hear about this lady you love,&rdquo; she said, jealousy clear in her tone. &ldquo;What kind of person is she?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francis chuckled, taking another drink. &ldquo;Well&hellip; she&rsquo;s confident, kind, cares about her family, and tries hard in everything she does. Her red hair is striking, just like her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s face was the brightest red it had ever been in her entire life. All of those characteristics, weren&rsquo;t they describing her? Could her feelings be&hellip; requited?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is there anything else you&rsquo;d like to hear?&rdquo; Francis asked knowingly. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind looked up into his eyes. She also took another drink. &ldquo;I want to hear you say that you love me,&rdquo; she said, slurring her words in a way that was almost sensual. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rosalind,&rdquo; Francis said slowly, caressing her cheek as he leaned in closer to her intoxicated eyes. &ldquo;I love you. I loved you in our past life, and I love you now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Their faces were very close now, to the point of touching. Rosalind placed her hand on his, and without hesitation, closed the distance with a bold, deep kiss.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As their hands moved to dangerous places, Francis pulled Rosalind onto his desk, his form now over hers. She looked into his dark blue eyes with a look of hunger, and before they knew it, clothes were coming off&hellip;</span></p><hr><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind and Francis lay on his desk, their naked forms not covered with anything. If someone walked in at that moment, they would be greeted to an excellent display of exhibitionism. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francis eyed Rosalind teasingly. &ldquo;Satisfied?&rdquo; he asked with a grin, noticing her bright blush. They were both fully sober now, and Rosalind had come to realize just how susceptible to alcohol she really was. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This was just supposed to be a talk over tea&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind said in embarrassment, holding her hands over her face. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t complaining earlier,&rdquo; Francis replied, running his hands over her naked shoulders. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind blushed. &ldquo;The Fran I remember wasn&rsquo;t this sly,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;How am I going to explain this to my parents?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tell them that you are getting engaged,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;Will they be able to turn down a marriage letter from the Shadow Duke?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, this is all wrong!&rdquo; Rosalind groaned. &ldquo;How did we even get here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;...your invitation?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame me!&rdquo; Rosalind cried. &ldquo;This is all your doing!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At that moment, the door to the study opened, a maid running in worriedly. &ldquo;Lady Rosalind, Duke Francis, is everything&mdash;?&rdquo; She froze, seeing them on the desk. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind covered herself with a squeak. &ldquo;Eek! This is&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; the maid exclaimed. She ran out of the room, screaming down the halls as she did so. &ldquo;Our lord is getting engaged!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind groaned, louder than the last. &ldquo;I might just die again,&rdquo; she murmured. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I guess that takes care of the engagement, right?&rdquo; Francis asked, laughing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Rosalind cried, hitting him playfully. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c15" id="h.eewbhgayo4jv"><span class="c18">Interlude 6 - Euphoric Love (unknown author)</span></h3><p class="c12"><span class="c0">A sudden spark ignited</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">A flame that I thought was out</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">But now it burns brighter</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Than I ever knew about</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">My heart beats faster<br>With every thought of you<br>I never expected to feel this way<br>But now I know it&rsquo;s true</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">You&rsquo;ve captured my soul<br>And I&rsquo;m never letting go<br>I&rsquo;m falling deeper in love<br>With every passing moment, you know</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Our love is euphoric<br>And I&rsquo;m grateful every day<br>For the unexpected love<br>That came my way</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c22" id="h.86jl9ymxzcws"><span class="c18">Chapter 15 - The Subject Of Her Envy</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Melody began with a grin. &ldquo;I heard you&rsquo;re getting engaged again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How did you&hellip;?&rdquo; Rosalind&rsquo;s head fell into her hands with a blush. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be public&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fran is getting engaged,&rdquo; Melody said, amused at her reaction. &ldquo;Of course people would gossip about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind glared at her. &ldquo;You know, you could have told me he was our old friend.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I thought you already knew!&rdquo; Melody laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you actually forgot about Fran?

She was always such a stoic person&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lady Rosalind,&rdquo; she began hesitantly. &ldquo;Do you truly want to be friends with me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind nodded. &ldquo;If&hellip; if that&rsquo;s okay with you,&rdquo; she murmured, her expression growing sad. &ldquo;I understand if you don&rsquo;t want to.

Rosalind looked absolutely miserable, but for some reason she couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to say yes. Why was that? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Why couldn&rsquo;t she see past all the horrible things Rosalind had done?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A sob suddenly escaped from Rosalind&rsquo;s lips as her head fell in her hands. &ldquo;I really am sorry,&rdquo; she murmured through tears. &ldquo;Why did I take it out on you? It wasn&rsquo;t even your fault. I&rsquo;m such a terrible person!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody pulled her into a hug. &ldquo;Rose,&rdquo; she muttered softly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. You aren&rsquo;t that person anymore. Don&rsquo;t torment yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If anyone deserves to be tormented, it&rsquo;s me!&rdquo; Rosalind cried. &ldquo;As repentance for all the torment I caused!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Marciella eyed her with pity and frowned. Was this really the same Rosalind she had known? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">She looks so desperate&hellip; would it truly be okay to forgive her?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Lady Rosalind,&rdquo; Marciella murmured sadly. &ldquo;It hurts to see you like this. But I don&rsquo;t know if we can be friends&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please, Lady Marciella,&rdquo; Melody said desperately. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you at least see her earnestness?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Marciella frowned. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;...festival&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind muttered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; Melody asked curiously. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the festival,&rdquo; Rosalind muttered again, louder this time. &ldquo;And forget the past for just this once.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Marciella considered her suggestion and nodded slowly. &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; </span></p><hr><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c16 c17">Is it possible to trust her? To forgive all that she did?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Marciella asked herself these questions as they walked through the festival. Rosalind and Melody stuck close together, while Marciella strayed behind them. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She admired Melody&rsquo;s confidence and ability to be forgiving of Rosalind. She found it difficult to act in the same way. Rosalind had done so many things, that forgiveness seemed far out of reach. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody frowned. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">I know what she&rsquo;s doing. She&rsquo;s trying to lure me in, so she can hurt me later on, right?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Or maybe she really is sorry for all that stuff she did&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">No, that can&rsquo;t be right, I know she&rsquo;s planning something.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She wished she wasn&rsquo;t so doubting, but years of bad treatment had turned her this way. After everything else, why should she believe Rosalind was acting out of genuine kindness or desire to apologize? This might have been some sort of terrible scheme again. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Marciella,&rdquo; Rosalind turned to her with a smile. &ldquo;Have you been here before?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Just once,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I want to take you on an adventure,&rdquo; Rosalind said, grabbing her by the hand. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have some fun.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind led her around the festival, showing her the tips and tricks she had developed over the years as a kid. They collected a ton of prizes, ate a lot of interesting food, and saw interesting sights. Slowly, Marciella was beginning to feel that her doubts were not warranted. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And that scared her. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">I still doubt her&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">But she&rsquo;s like a kid when she&rsquo;s here&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">She has such a great friendship with Melody, too&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Is she&hellip; genuine?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Finding a secluded place to sit outside the festival, they collected their breath. Marciella frowned as she considered what she should say to Rosalind. Should she forgive her or turn her down? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Marciella,&rdquo; Rosalind said, breaking her from her thoughts. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about earlier. You&hellip; don&rsquo;t have to forgive me, nor do you have to be my friend. Just&hellip; if we can be simply on good terms, that&rsquo;s enough for me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rosalind&hellip;&rdquo; Melody placed a hand on her shoulder. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Rosalind assured her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine as long as she doesn&rsquo;t hate me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Marciella looked to the ground. &ldquo;Let me think about it for a minute.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Rosalind said with a smile. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Marciella sat there for a few minutes considering everything she had seen thus far. Rosalind hadn&rsquo;t done anything to hurt her that night, nor had she said any hurtful things. All of Marciella&rsquo;s grievances were related to past events&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Could she truly forget about the past? Rosalind had done so many things, but it wasn&rsquo;t like she was the same person, right? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Maybe&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Maybe the right thing to do is forgive her&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But could Marciella bring herself to do it? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">I&hellip; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Rosalind stood up, looking around the area urgently. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Melody asked curiously. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too quiet,&rdquo; Rosalind muttered. There was no one around them, not even a single passerby. But Rosalind could feel several pairs of eyes on her, eyes that were filled with maliciousness. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lady Rosalind?&rdquo; Marciella eyed her in confusion. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shh!&rdquo; Rosalind put a finger up to her lips. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Melody,&rdquo; she whispered, turning to Melody. &ldquo;Go find Francis. Something&rsquo;s not right here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody looked around, also feeling the tense atmosphere. &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Rosalind assured with a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody reluctantly nodded with a frown. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get yourself hurt,&rdquo; she said firmly with a hint of worry, before slipping away. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Marciella watched her leave and tilted her head. &ldquo;Lady Rosalind, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; she asked worriedly. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At that moment, Silke appeared with an urgent look. &ldquo;My lady, someone&rsquo;s following us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I figured as much,&rdquo; Rosalind said, gritting her teeth. &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silke looked around. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before she could finish her sentence, Silke was hit in the shoulder by an arrow. She collapsed to the ground at Rosalind&rsquo;s feet. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Silke!&rdquo; Rosalind cried, checking her pulse worriedly. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lady Rosalind, what&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; Marciella asked, her voice frantic. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Assassins dropped down and surrounded them, blades in hand.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Come with us quietly, and you won&rsquo;t get hurt.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait, I recognize the girl next to her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, this is great,&rdquo; the assassin smiled evilly as he stared at Rosalind. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one who got us shut down a while back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you take Marciella,&rdquo; Rosalind snarled, though her voice was shaking.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c16">Marciella&rsquo;s eyes widened. </span><span class="c11">She&rsquo;s putting herself in harm&#39;s way&hellip; for me?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And what are you going to do to us?&rdquo; The assassin sneered. &ldquo;Your precious knight is knocked out. There&rsquo;s no one here to save you.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And before she could say another word, Rosalind was hit on the head with the hilt of a blade, knocking her out instantly.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c22" id="h.i0m1jffxw91q"><span class="c18">Chapter 16 - Her Forgotten Solace</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lady Rosalind, are you alright?&rdquo; asked Marciella. They found themselves in a dirty prison cell, surrounded by assassins who looked in with malicious eyes. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, just a little dizzy, but I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Rosalind replied, forcing a smile despite the nausea swirling in her head.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Marciella glanced at her with concern. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for getting you involved in this. You shouldn&rsquo;t have&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Marciella,&rdquo; Rosalind interrupted gently. &ldquo;It was my choice, not yours.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c16">But Marciella&rsquo;s frown deepened. </span><span class="c11">Have I misjudged her?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before she could say something in response, the cell door creaked open, and two assassins entered, sharp blades in hand. Their presence was intense and intimidating. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You better not make any noise,&rdquo; one warned, his voice cold. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind placed herself in front of Marciella. &ldquo;Let Marciella go,&rdquo; she hissed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s an innocent girl!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Innocent?&rdquo; the other gruffer assassin tilted his head. &ldquo;Someone wants her dead. She must have crossed the wrong person.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the future queen of this country!&rdquo; Rosalind shouted, her voice unwavering despite her fear. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get away with harming her!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; the assassin exclaimed, grabbing her roughly by the arm. She struggled, her nails digging into his gloves. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you touch her!&rdquo; Rosalind declared, wrestling with him. But she was unfortunately weak in the face of his trained strength. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of you,&rdquo; the assassin hissed, flinging her against the stone wall with brutal force. He pulled out his blade as she held her shoulder groaning. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip; I won&rsquo;t&hellip; let you&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind murmured, her voice faltering. She stumbled, feeling the aftershock of the collision she just experienced. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The assassin sneered and raised his blade before she could register. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Searing pain shot through her as she felt a graze of metal on her cheek. A sharp scream tore from her lips and she fell to the ground, holding the right side of her face as blood poured all over her clothes. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lady Rosalind!&rdquo; Marciella screamed, her anguished cry echoing through the cell. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">She protected me&hellip; I doubted her all this time, and she still&mdash; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Marciella crawled over to her, shaking her desperately. &ldquo;Lady Rosalind, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for doubting you, and I&rsquo;m sorry for getting you into this mess.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind smiled weakly, her vision fading. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; not your fault&hellip;&rdquo; she muttered, before everything went black. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The last thing she saw was the slash of an imperial sword cutting through one of the assassins&hellip;</span></p><hr><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Marciella!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind sat up in bed, feeling weak all over. She looked around, finding herself in an ornate bedroom, which she recognized from the Ashewood Estate. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But as she took in her surroundings, she also realized that the right side of her face was bandaged. She rubbed the bandages and winced at the stinging sensation. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Francis?&rdquo; she whispered aloud, expecting to see him. &ldquo;Fran?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The door to the room opened, revealing Francis and Melody, who were talking worriedly. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Are you sure she&rsquo;s okay, Fran?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fine, it was just a scratch.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;But her face is scarred.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;At least she&rsquo;s still alive.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They froze upon seeing her staring at them with an amused smile. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rose!&rdquo; they cried in unison, rushing to her side. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re awake.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How long was I asleep?&rdquo; Rosalind asked, her voice weak. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Just a few hours,&rdquo; Francis said with a relieved smile. &ldquo;The doctor said you might have to rest for a while.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Rosalind nodded. &ldquo;What about Marciella?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been worried about you,&rdquo; Melody reassured her. &ldquo;She said she wants to start exchanging letters once you get better.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s smile widened. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francis and Melody glanced at each other. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rosalind, what happened?&rdquo; Francis asked. &ldquo;Why were you both kidnapped?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s expression darkened. &ldquo;One of the assassins mentioned that someone hired him to kill Marciella.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody gasped. &ldquo;Who would threaten the future queen so blatantly?&rdquo; she asked in surprise. &ldquo;It has to be someone bold&mdash;or desperate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind nodded, thinking of the various nobles she knew and considering their possible connections to Marciella. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c16 c17">Only someone as villainous as I once was would attempt something so heinous.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A sudden name floated to Rosalind&rsquo;s mind, sending a deep chill down her spine. It was a name she didn&rsquo;t want to think of, but one that made all the sense in the world. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Violetta&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind muttered finally, gritting her teeth.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francis&rsquo; eyes widened. &ldquo;Lady Violetta? The woman you&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, choosing his words carefully. &ldquo;The one always talking about her love for Prince Vicente?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who else?&rdquo; Rosalind said, her tone sharp.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But she would never hire assassins to kill someone,&rdquo; Melody countered, shaking her head. &ldquo;It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be surprised,&rdquo; Rosalind said grimly. &ldquo;She has a way of hiding her true self in public.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francis frowned. &ldquo;If she&rsquo;s behind this, what&rsquo;s her next move?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If I were her&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind began, thinking of her previous life. &ldquo;I would plan for the next public event&hellip; just like the festival.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody nodded thoughtfully. &ldquo;I believe Prince Vicente is holding a party in a week,&rdquo; she recalled. &ldquo;Some say he&rsquo;s going to announce his engagement to&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She froze. Rosalind grinned. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What better place to get revenge than where her rival is announced?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody shook her head. &ldquo;Sometimes, the fact that you were once a villainess frightens me.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind smiled wryly. &ldquo;Takes one to know one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francis chuckled. &ldquo;You should rest, Rosalind,&rdquo; he said, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder. &ldquo;Tomorrow, why don&rsquo;t we have a talk over some tea?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind narrowed her eyes suspiciously. &ldquo;Tea?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, actual tea,&rdquo; Francis replied with a knowing look. &ldquo;Not like last time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Last time?&rdquo; Melody asked, glancing between them curiously. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, Melody,&rdquo; Francis said quickly with a smile. &ldquo;We should let Rosalind rest.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They left the room before Melody could protest. </span></p><hr><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The next day, they sat around a table in Francis&rsquo; study, having tea together. The room was filled with the clinking of porcelain and the faint scent of fresh brew. The autumn sun streamed through the windows, bathing them in a warm light. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s the plan?&rdquo; Melody asked, sipping her tea while her inquisitive eyes glanced between Rosalind and Francis. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We should attend the party,&rdquo; Rosalind replied, her expression contemplative but calm. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My thoughts exactly,&rdquo; Francis agreed with a thoughtful nod. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all? No contingencies?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind shook her head slightly. &ldquo;We have no idea what Violetta plans to do. We just have to be prepared.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The trio discussed the party for a while longer, speculating on Violetta&rsquo;s motives and how they might outsmart her, but eventually the conversation drifted. It had been far too long since they sat down like this&mdash;just three old friends, enjoying each other&rsquo;s company over tea. So rather than bask in the seriousness, they talked about whatever they could. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; Rosalind said after a while, her voice soft as she set her cup down. &ldquo;I really missed this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis nodded, his eyes lingering on her for a moment longer than necessary. &ldquo;We should do this more often.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody, who had been stirring her tea absentmindedly, noticed his gaze and grinned. &ldquo;Is that because you actually want to have tea, or is it really because you want to see Rosalind?&rdquo; she asked teasingly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis didn&rsquo;t hesitate, his calm demeanor unshaken. &ldquo;Both.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind blushed, the pink on her cheeks darkening as she looked to the ground. &ldquo;Fran&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, this is going to be awkward,&rdquo; Melody said with a laugh. &ldquo;How can I have tea with two people who are all over each other?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t all over each other&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind protested, though her shy expression betrayed her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You might as well be,&rdquo; Melody countered with a smirk. &ldquo;Francis has been stealing glances at you all morning. And don&rsquo;t think I didn&rsquo;t notice the way you keep smiling every time he does.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I do not!&rdquo; Rosalind exclaimed, her voice rising higher than she intended. She immediately bit her lip, her cheeks reddening in embarrassment. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis leaned forward and rested his chin on his hand. &ldquo;Melody, you&#39;re incorrigible. But, for the record,&rdquo; he added with a hint of a grin. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if we were, Rosalind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind froze, her teacup nearly inches away from her face. With a sharp clink, she slammed it down onto its saucer, her face growing hotter by the second. &ldquo;Francis, you&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Francis asked, his tone calm as he met her gaze. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just speaking my mind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What kind of ridiculous fantasies is your mind conjuring?&rdquo; Rosalind mumbled, covering her face in a futile attempt to hide. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody nearly doubled over with laughter, clutching her chest. &ldquo;Oh, this is gold!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t mind me; I&rsquo;ll just be over here, watching this theatrical masterpiece you&rsquo;re both putting on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind buried her face in her hands, trying to will away the warmth in her cheeks. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re both impossible,&rdquo; she muttered, though she couldn&rsquo;t help the smile that formed on her face. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They laughed together, sharing teasing remarks back and forth. For just a moment, the tension that had been weighing on their shoulders faded into nothing, replaced with a deep feeling of nostalgia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind had accomplished so much since waking up in the past, but compared to everything else&hellip; bringing her friends back together was probably her most favorite achievement. </span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c22" id="h.xo70soal3maa"><span class="c18">Chapter 17 - Succumbing To Fate (Part One)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind eyed herself in the mirror, grinning at her radiant form. Everything was perfect.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My lady,&rdquo; Bethany glanced at her with a frown, her arms crossed in slight disapproval. &ldquo;Is this really what you&rsquo;re going to wear?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Rosalind replied confidently, tying a few ribbons onto her dress. &ldquo;This is an important night.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Bethany sighed. &ldquo;Just be careful, my lady,&rdquo; she said softly, sensing Rosalind was about to do something reckless. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind turned, pulling Bethany into a quick hug. &ldquo;Do you even have to remind me?&rdquo; </span></p><hr><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, Francis and Melody sat in a grand carriage, waiting for Rosalind outside her estate. Francis fidgeted with the cuffs of his sleeve, his impatience growing with every second. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s late,&rdquo; he muttered, frowning. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been only a few minutes,&rdquo; Melody said, chuckling as she leaned back in her seat. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ll get to see her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, the carriage door opened, revealing Rosalind. Francis and Melody&rsquo;s eyes went wide and their mouths fell open in surprise at her attire. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She wore a sultry red dress adorned with tiny gems, accented with a necklace made up of diamonds. Her red hair was styled to perfection, loose strands framing her face, and atop her head sat a small tiara that would make even a princess cry. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You look&hellip; beautiful,&rdquo; Francis murmured, being the first to find any words. &ldquo;Stunning beyond measure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s cheeks turned the color of her dress as she sat down next to him. It was hard for her to make eye contact after hearing his words. &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she replied softly. &ldquo;You look handsome, yourself, Fran.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francis&rsquo; lips curved into a warm smile. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before either of them could think too much about it, they kissed, which made even Melody blush. That surprising action seemed to make her finally find her voice again. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c16">&ldquo;Are we here to prevent an assassination or to seduce the entire party?&rdquo; she asked, turning away to avoid watching their make out session (they hadn&rsquo;t stopped). &ldquo;And for heaven&rsquo;s sake, </span><span class="c16 c17">stop kissing in front of me!</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><hr><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The doors to the ballroom opened wide, revealing a dazzling atmosphere. Every party held by Prince Vicente was more extravagant than the last, and this was no exception. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Entering Lady Rosalind Harcourt, Lord Francis Ashewood, and Lady Melody Astrale!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The announcer&rsquo;s voice rang out, cutting through the chatter, and the names that followed caught everyone&rsquo;s attention. A murmur rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Did he just say Ashewood? As in, the Shadow Duke?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;I think he did! And he&rsquo;s entering with Lady Melody and Lady Rosalind!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Wait, look at that! His arm is wrapped around Lady Rosalind&rsquo;s! She&rsquo;s his date?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">&ldquo;What on earth is she wearing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind rolled her eyes. &ldquo;They never stop, do they?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; Francis nodded with a resigned sigh.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tell me about it,&rdquo; Melody said, shaking her head. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind took it all in with a practiced eye. She noted the tight-knit groups of nobles, their conversations hushed, the servants, who carried themselves with a quiet efficiency, and most importantly, the strategic vantage points from which someone like Violetta might observe unnoticed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;See anyone suspicious?&rdquo; Melody whispered, leaning close.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Rosalind replied. &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s here. She wouldn&rsquo;t miss this opportunity.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francis scanned the room, his brow furrowed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll make a move when no one expects it. Until then, let&rsquo;s not give her any reason to suspect us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They split up, searching around the venue for any sign of Violetta, but couldn&rsquo;t find anything. It was a big party, and there were a lot of attendees. Finding Violetta would probably be nothing short of a miracle, like a needle in a haystack. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ever so often, the trio would lock eyes with each other and shake their heads, confirming their lack of success. Rosalind was growing increasingly frustrated and worried. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, amongst the sea of faces, she finally saw her. Violetta stood alone on a secluded outdoor balcony, wearing a dark green dress; her presence was unmistakable. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind locked eyes with Melody and Francis, silently signaling for them to stay back. There was something about the way Violetta stood there, a strange grin playing at the corners of her lips, that made Rosalind&rsquo;s instincts flare.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lady Violetta,&rdquo; said Rosalind, stepping out onto the balcony with careful steps. &ldquo;You are hard to track down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Violetta turned slowly, her smile widening. &ldquo;You and your friends are certainly paranoid,&rdquo; she responded coolly. &ldquo;Stalking an innocent woman during a party.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re onto us,&rdquo; Rosalind said, gritting her teeth. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Violetta said calmly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard not to notice when people are looking for me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind narrowed her eyes. &ldquo;What are you planning?&rdquo; she asked curiously. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t here for no reason.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Violetta chuckled softly, her expression wistful. &ldquo;I suppose you could say I&rsquo;ve been working two lifetimes for the one I love.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Two lifetimes?&rdquo; Rosalind&rsquo;s eyes went wide as she realized. &ldquo;That means you&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c16">&ldquo;Have memories of another time?&rdquo; Violetta finished with a grin. &ldquo;Indeed. Did you think you were the only one with knowledge of our </span><span class="c16 c17">previous lives</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s breath caught in her throat. She had suspected her tricks were familiar, but hearing the words confirmed something deep and unsettling.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&hellip;? How do you&mdash;?&rdquo; she stammered, but Violetta waved her off as if the answer were obvious.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why else would the terrible villainess change so drastically?&rdquo; Violetta asked with a knowing look. &ldquo;When I realized the truth, I used it to my advantage. I waited until you were weak enough, when the &lsquo;villainess&rsquo; was fully gone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But why take this path?&rdquo; Rosalind asked, her voice hardening. &ldquo;You could have chosen a different way.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Violetta&rsquo;s expression turned cold as she stepped closer, her hand coming up to lightly caress Rosalind&rsquo;s hair in a cruel gesture. &ldquo;When you sent me to that prison of hell, I prayed and prayed for this second chance,&rdquo; she said, her voice low. &ldquo;The gods granted me this opportunity for revenge.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind slapped her hand away, her anger flaring. &ldquo;That second chance was my opportunity, not yours! And even then, it could have been a chance for you to repent, for you to make a change!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A change?&rdquo; Violetta repeated with a lifeless laugh. &ldquo;And become weak like you? I think not.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s eyes flashed with fury, and she clenched her fists, stepping forward. &ldquo;If you want revenge, take it out on me. Don&rsquo;t involve Marciella in this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I would love nothing more, Rosalind,&rdquo; Violetta said spitefully, grabbing her by the chin. &ldquo;But you aren&rsquo;t the same villainess you used to be. Having faced death, you&rsquo;ve become fragile&mdash;insignificant. But I must thank you. Most of my ideas were inspired by yours, from my previous life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you harm Marciella,&rdquo; Rosalind hissed. &ldquo;Your plans will fail.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Violetta said in mock sorrow. &ldquo;Which is why I must get rid of the unwanted trash first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Violetta snapped her fingers, and several assassins appeared from the shadows, dropping silently onto the balcony. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Deal with her,&rdquo; she said coldly, walking away before Rosalind could stop her. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The assassins surged forward, weapons drawn, but Rosalind was quick to react, barely dodging the fierce blows. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing personal, madam,&rdquo; said one of the assassins in mock formality. &ldquo;But we must follow our orders.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to sound respectable,&rdquo; Rosalind snapped, her hand shooting out to halt the assassin&rsquo;s sword mid-swing. Blood spurted from her left hand as the blade met her skin, and she winced slightly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not an ounce of honor in your veins!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up and die!&rdquo; the assassin growled, slashing his sword before Rosalind could react. She was prepared for a direct hit, but a clash of metal stopped them in their tracks. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My lady!&rdquo; a familiar voice exclaimed, and Rosalind looked up in surprise. Silke had arrived just in time. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Get out of here!&rdquo; she yelled, forcing back their swords. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold them off!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you, Silke,&rdquo; Rosalind called, her heart racing as she seized the moment to break free. With a single glance toward her trusted knight, she turned and darted off after Violetta. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind had no idea what was going to happen next, but she knew one thing: she had to stop Violetta before it was too late. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c22" id="h.9to0mzirhmgw"><span class="c18">Chapter 18 - Succumbing To Fate (Part Two)</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind ran back to the ballroom, wrapping her bleeding hand in a loose piece of ribbon from her dress. The pain was unbearable, but she had no time to focus on it. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Violetta was about to make a move, and she had to make sure nothing happened to Marciella in the process. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She found Melody and Francis standing to the side and rejoined them, catching her breath. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rosalind!&rdquo; Melody exclaimed, her eyes widening in relief. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been looking everywhere for you! What happened to&mdash;oh my goodness, your hand!&rdquo; She reached out instinctively, but Rosalind pulled her arm back.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There was&hellip; a disturbance,&rdquo; Rosalind said curtly, trying not to worry her. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no time to worry about that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her gaze darted across the room, and there, near a distant window, she saw Violetta approaching Marciella from afar. Signals were going off in her brain, even more so when she observed a suspicious maid hanging nearby.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Francis,&rdquo; Rosalind whispered, leaning closer to him. &ldquo;Go find Prince Vicente. Something&rsquo;s about to happen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francis frowned. &ldquo;What about you? You&rsquo;re hurt&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that. I&rsquo;ll handle Violetta,&rdquo; Rosalind said firmly, appreciating his concern but choosing to ignore it. &ldquo;Melody, you stay back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody shook her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let you walk into danger&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You have to,&rdquo; Rosalind interrupted, her voice cold but steady. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a request.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve already put yourself in harms way&mdash;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Melody,&rdquo; Rosalind&rsquo;s expression softened just enough to convey her intentions. &ldquo;Let me handle this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Melody muttered with a reluctant nod. &ldquo;But please don&rsquo;t do anything stupid.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind said nothing in response, simply smiling wistfully before walking away. </span></p><hr><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Standing in a rare moment of personal space, Marciella allowed herself to relax. She had been overwhelmed by all of the eager conversations that had sprung up.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c16">But on this particular day, she also felt tense. A few days ago she had received a letter from Rosalind that simply said: </span><span class="c16 c17">Be careful. Watch your surroundings. Someone is after you. The assassins are connected. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">How could she relax after seeing such a warning? The words haunted her. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She couldn&rsquo;t go a single second without feeling distrust, even though it hurt to do so. Marciella loved talking with people, she loved conversations in general, but that just wasn&rsquo;t easy if everyone seemed suspicious. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lady Marciella,&rdquo; said a voice from behind her. &ldquo;Your position precedes you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Marciella turned, her pleasant expression faltering as she met the gaze of a woman clad in deep green silk. The stranger&rsquo;s smile didn&rsquo;t reach her sharp, calculating eyes. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; Marciella began nervously, holding out her hand. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;ve met.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the lady said rudely, ignoring Marciella&rsquo;s open hand. &ldquo;You may call me Violetta.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Er, I see&hellip;&rdquo; Marciella said uncomfortably, her unease deepening. &ldquo;Nice to meet you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Violetta turned her nose up snobbishly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard you are getting engaged to Prince Vicente,&rdquo; she said with a glint of disdain in her eyes. &ldquo;Certainly a great rise for someone of your&hellip; status.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Marciella frowned. &ldquo;I happen to be proud of who I am,&rdquo; she said confidently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t appreciate your tone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c16">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not allow ourselves to become brutes, Lady Marciella,&rdquo; Violetta said, her words dripping with condescension. &ldquo;</span><span class="c16 c17">Commoners</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;may fall to such lows, but we are </span><span class="c16 c17">nobles</span><span class="c0">, are we not?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Marciella couldn&rsquo;t ignore the hostility and aggressiveness being displayed. She took a cautious step backwards. &ldquo;You seem to dislike me, Lady Violetta,&rdquo; she said bluntly. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I suppose you aren&rsquo;t a total fool,&rdquo; Violetta said with a twisted smile. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s diffuse these tensions with some drinks, shall we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Violetta snapped her fingers, and a maid appeared by her side suspiciously fast. It was like she had been planted for a very specific reason. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, my lady?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bring us some wine,&rdquo; Violetta said. Even her words felt acted, like part of a show.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, just as fast as the maid appeared, she reappeared with a tray of two wine glasses. Violetta took one of the glasses and drank it with a strange look. &ldquo;This wine is exquisite. You should have some, Lady Marciella.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Marciella stared at the drink tray, her brows furrowed as she hesitated.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Violetta pressed, her voice far too sweet. &ldquo;Wine such as this is hard to come by. You should partake.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Marciella glanced at the glass, doubt gnawing at her. &ldquo;But&hellip; Prince Vicente once told me&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To be cautious of rogue drinks? Surely a simple glass of wine is fine, right? I have no reason to hurt you. We&rsquo;re simply two noblewomen sharing a cordial conversation over some drinks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The tension was palpable as Marciella reached hesitantly toward the glass. But before her fingers could touch it, a familiar voice broke through the charged atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Marciella, it&rsquo;s great to see you in one piece!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Marciella spun around, relief filling her features. &ldquo;Lady Rosalind!&rdquo; she exclaimed, looking over her worriedly. &ldquo;Are you all right? I was so worried&mdash;goodness, your hand!&rdquo; She reached for Rosalind, but she waved her off.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, Marciella. Everyone took care of me. However&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind turned to Violetta. &ldquo;It seems you&rsquo;ve been having an interesting conversation with Lady Violetta.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Violetta forced a smile. &ldquo;We were just discussing marriage over drinks. It&rsquo;s nothing for you to be concerned about, Lady Rosalind,&rdquo; she said, eyeing the drink tray.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Rosalind said, frowning at the gaze in Lady Violetta&rsquo;s eyes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c16 c17">Marciella&rsquo;s going to get hurt if I don&rsquo;t stop this. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be on my way,&rdquo; Rosalind started, a hint of sadness in her tone, &ldquo;But first I wanted to tell you something, Marciella.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Marciella tilted her head. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind grabbed the suspicious glass, which caused Violetta&rsquo;s eyes to widen. &ldquo;Lady Rosalind&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Be happy,&rdquo; Rosalind said simply, before drinking the entire glass in one nervous gulp. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t panic at what you see.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sensing the odd finality in Rosalind&rsquo;s tone, Marciella&rsquo;s expression turned worried. &ldquo;Lady Rosalind, what are you&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But before she could finish her sentence, Rosalind collapsed to the ground, clutching her chest in pain. Her eyes bulged as she gasped and groaned. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Marciella screamed before she could even control it. &ldquo;Rosalind!&rdquo; she cried, causing everyone to look over at them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gasps, whispers, and screams broke out across the room. Melody dropped her glass, a look of worry in her eyes. &ldquo;Rosalind&hellip;?&rdquo; she whispered aloud.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Violetta looked around, sensing the danger of the situation. She tried to run away before anyone would see her. &ldquo;Damn! Why did she&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But before she could, Francis placed a hand on her shoulder, a look of fury in his eyes. &ldquo;Lady Violetta,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Did you think you could run away?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;T-this is a misunderstanding!&rdquo; Violetta tried to defend herself. &ldquo;I was going to get help!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You expect me to believe that?&rdquo; Francis asked, holding up the broken wine glass. &ldquo;You were trying to force Lady Marciella to drink that wine and Rosalind interrupted. It was poisoned, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip; I had nothing to do with that&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Prince Vicente appeared beside her, placing his hand on her other shoulder. &ldquo;Did you think you could try this again?&rdquo; he asked angrily. &ldquo;After hiring assassins so blatantly?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Lady Violetta gritted her teeth. &ldquo;I wanted to make her suffer! She took me away from you, your highness! And even if the poison failed this time, I still took care of that insufferable villainess! You should be thanking me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Prince Vicente frowned, his face darkening. &ldquo;Villainess or not, you still attempted to harm my wife. Twice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He motioned to the guards, who placed her in handcuffs. Violetta grew hysterical, yelling out whatever terrible words she could think of to get their attention. &ldquo;Prince Vicente!&rdquo; she cried desperately. &ldquo;Is it so wrong for me to love you? Please don&rsquo;t do this to me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But Vicente and Francis turned away from her, ignoring her pleas as she was shamefully led out of the ballroom. Silence reigned following her absence, as the nobles present were hesitant to disrupt the tension. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let this be a warning,&rdquo; Vicente said, raising his voice for all to hear. He wrapped consoling arms around a crying Marciella. &ldquo;As the heir to this country, I won&rsquo;t stand for anyone who harms my wife, nor the ones close to her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">All present had no choice but to nod in the face of his powerful words. If they attempted something like Violetta did, they probably would end up embarrassed in the same way. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francis barely registered Vicente&rsquo;s words as he leaned down, clutching Rosalind&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Rosalind&hellip; answer me, Rosalind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind could barely see, her vision foggy. The only face she could make out was Francis&rsquo;, who was the closest to her. She wished she could also see her friend, Melody&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;F-Fran&hellip;? Take care of&hellip; Melody&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind said, her voice hoarse. That was the last word she uttered, before her eyes closed with ominous finality.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rosalind? Rosalind!&rdquo; Francis called her name frantically, but no answer came. Melody stood from afar, only able to cry silently in her distress. She couldn&rsquo;t even bring herself to move.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh my god!&rdquo; Marciella held her hands over her mouth, tears rolling down her face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry! She did this&hellip; all because of me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault, Marcella,&rdquo; said Prince Vicente, tightening his embrace. &ldquo;Perhaps this was her way of finally atoning for everything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Atoning?&rdquo; Francis gritted his teeth, his look of fury causing everyone to flinch. &ldquo;Do you know how hurt she was? Do you know how hard she worked to make everyone like her? She may have done some bad things once, but she wanted to repent! But you kept doubting her, until&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He looked down at her sadly. &ldquo;Until it led to this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Marciella frowned. &ldquo;I&hellip; I never thought she would feel guilt for what she did to me&hellip; how was I supposed to? She always hated me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Everyone is capable of change. But we have to be the ones to see it,&rdquo; said Francis, pulling Rosalind into his arms. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t follow me. You&rsquo;ll only be able to see her when she wakes. And that won&rsquo;t be any time soon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He and Melody walked away in sorrowful silence, leaving a quiet crowd in their wake. Marciella could only watch them, feeling an overwhelming sense of guilt. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; she whispered, burying her face in Vicente&rsquo;s shoulder.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c26" id="h.d74wmrh9784k"><span class="c18">Interlude ? - Somewhere</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Rosalind heard a voice whispering in her ear, but everything was quiet. She felt cold, like being encased in ice, but warmth was around her. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Then a new voice, clear and firm, reaches her ears. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c21 c17">It is not your time</span><span class="c16 c17">, the voice said. </span><span class="c28 c21 c17">Rest, then the miracle will be concluded upon your waking. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Rosalind didn&rsquo;t know who was talking, nor did she know what their words meant, but despite it all, she felt tired. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c16 c17">And so, she went to rest&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c22" id="h.aiyefe8ilr2f"><span class="c18">Chapter 19 - Death Of The Villainess</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind slowly opened her eyes, finding herself overcome with a heavy feeling of weariness. It felt as if she hadn&rsquo;t moved her body in a long time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">How long had she been asleep? Was that a dream she saw? It felt like she had seen it so long ago&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind glanced at her surroundings, smiling upon seeing Melody sitting in a chair next to her bed, holding her hand gently. She was currently asleep, probably having sat there waiting for her. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For a while, Rosalind just sat there, observing Melody&rsquo;s peaceful sleeping form. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nhn&hellip;&rdquo; Melody woke up, her eyes going wide at the sight of weary Rosalind. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rosalind&hellip;?&rdquo; Melody stood up slowly, tears forming in her eyes. &ldquo;Rosalind!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody hugged her tightly, sobbing uncontrollably. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; Rosalind said with a smile, almost crying herself. &ldquo;I was just sleeping for a bit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sleeping for a bit? Rosalind, you&rsquo;ve been asleep for nearly three years!&rdquo; Melody cried. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Three years&hellip;?&rdquo; Rosalind said in surprise. &ldquo;But what happened to Violetta?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She was executed a few days after you were poisoned,&rdquo; Melody explained. &ldquo;Her threats against you and Marciella were too severe to ignore.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind frowned. &ldquo;She could have chosen a better life,&rdquo; she said sadly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want her to die. No one deserves to die.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody stared at her in silence for a few seconds and frowned. &ldquo;Rosalind&hellip;&rdquo; she looked to the ground. &ldquo;Francis told me&hellip; about the past...&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind tilted her head. &ldquo;The past?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody nodded sadly. &ldquo;As in&hellip; our previous life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s eyes went wide. &ldquo;What&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He said that time was reversed&hellip;&rdquo; Melody said. &ldquo;I always had these dreams, these blips that I thought were simply nothing, but&hellip; was it really a forgotten future?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind nodded hesitantly. &ldquo;Me and Fran&hellip; we both returned to fix our past mistakes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody suddenly hugged her. &ldquo;I saw you die,&rdquo; she whispered softly, her voice shaking. &ldquo;When you drank that poison, I thought&hellip; I thought that my worst nightmares were coming true.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind held her close, patting her softly on the back. &ldquo;Shh, it&rsquo;s alright, Melody,&rdquo; she said soothingly. &ldquo;As you can see, I&rsquo;m perfectly alive.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody could only nod silently, her sobs echoing throughout the room for a few minutes. Rosalind smiled, feeling grateful for her best friend, her dearest ally. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, the sound of something falling reached her ears. Rosalind looked toward the door and saw Francis standing there in shock.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rosalind&hellip;?&rdquo; He rushed over, hugging her as well. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how worried I&rsquo;ve been!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for scaring you all,&rdquo; Rosalind said with a smile. &ldquo;How is my family?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your brothers and parents have lost their minds in worry,&rdquo; Melody mumbled, shaking her head. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve not been the same since you were poisoned.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then who&rsquo;s managing the family affairs?&rdquo; Rosalind asked worriedly. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your little sister Eliza has been taking care of them,&rdquo; Francis said. &ldquo;She was the only one who stood strong in the face of your condition. It seems she&rsquo;s learning quickly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my girl,&rdquo; Rosalind said proudly. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francis held her gaze, something unspoken passing between them. Melody, ever perceptive, noticed and cleared her throat dramatically. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, standing abruptly with a sniffle. &ldquo;I suppose I should give you two some privacy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind shook her head. &ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t have to&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Melody exclaimed, already walking towards the door. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re engaged! Spend time with your fianc&eacute;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She left before either of them could protest. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">An awkward silence suddenly descended upon the room. Rosalind glanced at Francis, a nervous laugh escaping her lips. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; she began nervously. &ldquo;How have you been&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind barely had time to finish the sentence, as Francis pulled her into a deep kiss. Startled at first, she quickly relaxed into his embrace, her hands finding their way to his chest as she kissed him back with equal fervor.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fran&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered, her cheeks burning and her eyes intoxicated by the heat of the moment. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry for being sudden,&rdquo; Francis muttered, his voice quieter than she had ever heard. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help myself. It&rsquo;s been difficult without you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s lips curved into a small smile and she kissed him again. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize,&rdquo; she said, her voice soft but steady. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you too.&rdquo;</span></p><hr><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Soft morning light shown through the tall, ornate windows of the Ashewood mansion, as Francis gently supported Rosalind, his arm steadying her delicate frame. He led her slowly to the dining room, and she leaned on him more than she cared to admit. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to push yourself like this,&rdquo; Francis murmured as they reached the doorway. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine to take things slow. There&rsquo;s no rush.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Rosalind replied, though the weary look in her eyes said otherwise. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rosalind!&rdquo; Melody&rsquo;s worried voice rang out as they entered the dining room. She shot up from her seat, rushing to her friend&rsquo;s side in worry. &ldquo;What are you doing out of bed? Are you sure you should be moving around?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind offered a faint smile, wincing as Francis guided her gently to a chair at the head of the dining table. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay in bed forever,&rdquo; she mumbled, sinking into it with a soft sigh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m alright. Just a little&hellip; weak. And hungry.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francis glanced toward a nearby maid and signaled her over. &ldquo;Bring us some food,&rdquo; he instructed. &ldquo;And tell the head chef to prepare a light, easily digestible soup for Rosalind.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, your grace,&rdquo; the maid said with a bow. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody crossed her arms as she stared at Rosalind. &ldquo;You really should have stayed in bed,&rdquo; she chided with a frown. &ldquo;Right now, all you&rsquo;re doing is pushing yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; Rosalind replied, though her voice lacked conviction. &ldquo;Is it wrong for me to want to be part of things again?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody hesitated, her expression softening. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not wrong. But&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At that moment, the maid returned with a tray of food, placing a steaming bowl of soup before Rosalind. The aroma wafted up to her, comforting and enticing, but as she reached for the utensils, her hand trembled. She tried to steady herself, but even the simple act of lifting the spoon proved to be difficult for her.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My hands&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even&hellip; feel them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Melody sighed, her worry deepening. &ldquo;See what I mean? You&rsquo;re overdoing it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before Rosalind could reply, Francis intervened. Without a word, he took the spoon from her hand, scooped up a portion of the soup, and held it out to her. Rosalind&rsquo;s cheeks colored slightly, before she leaned forward to accept the spoonful, her blush darkening as the warm soup made contact with her mouth. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;T-thank you&hellip;&rdquo; Rosalind murmured, avoiding his gaze. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c16">Francis merely nodded, offering her another spoonful. Melody, watching the exchange, felt her cheeks growing warmer, but said nothing&mdash;for now. </span><span class="c16 c17">You lovebirds&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rosalind,&rdquo; she began, breaking the silence. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much to catch you up on. The country&rsquo;s changed a lot in the past three years.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind glanced at her curiously. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked, her words followed by another spoonful of soup from Francis.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;For one,&rdquo; Melody said, leaning forward, &ldquo;Lady Beatrice has been working on becoming less shy. She&rsquo;s even started hosting small tea parties at her estate. It&rsquo;s a big deal for her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s eyes widened slightly. &ldquo;Beatrice? Hosting tea parties? That&rsquo;s&hellip; hard to imagine.&rdquo; She paused as Francis fed her another spoonful, her blush returning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody rolled her eyes at the interaction but continued. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. She&rsquo;s still nervous, but she&rsquo;s come a long way. And Marciella&mdash;well, she&rsquo;s been trying to become the kind of woman who can stand by Prince Vicente&rsquo;s side. She&rsquo;s been taking etiquette lessons and getting involved in charity work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That sounds like Marciella,&rdquo; Rosalind said with a soft smile, another spoonful of soup punctuating her words. &ldquo;She always did want to prove herself worthy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis glanced at Melody as he prepared the next spoonful. &ldquo;And what about you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What have you been up to?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody flushed slightly, caught off guard. &ldquo;Me? Oh, nothing impressive,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been&hellip; keeping things running smoothly, hiring new employees, managing business, that sort of thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being modest, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Rosalind asked knowingly, accepting another spoonful of soup. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always been the one keeping us grounded.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody waved a hand dismissively, though her cheeks turned pink. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that&hellip;,&rdquo; she muttered. Then, unable to stop herself, she added, &ldquo;But seriously, do you two really have to do this while we&rsquo;re talking?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; Rosalind asked, genuinely confused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This!&rdquo; Melody exclaimed, gesturing at Francis grabbing a spoonful. &ldquo;Every time you say something, he&rsquo;s there feeding you, like a scene out of a romantic fairy tale. It&rsquo;s&hellip; distracting!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s cheeks flared bright red. &ldquo;I-it&rsquo;s not like that!&rdquo; she stammered, flustered. &ldquo;Y-you were the one who said I shouldn&rsquo;t strain myself!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis, on the other hand, simply smirked with a nod. &ldquo;Yes, she needs her strength,&rdquo; he said casually, slipping another spoonful into her mouth. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t mind helping.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody groaned, burying her face in her hands. &ldquo;This is so hard to watch,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you two just get married already?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Both Rosalind and Francis froze. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s blush, already intense, deepened impossibly further. She glanced at Francis, then quickly looked away, a shameless smile forming on her face. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; not a bad idea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c26" id="h.h2eajg42f77"><span class="c18">Final Interlude - Anchor</span></h3><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Eliza looked out the window of the study and frowned. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Would her sister ever wake up? </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">She had tried her best to stay strong for the sake of the family, because she knew that was what Rosalind would have wanted, but how could she? </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">How could a 12 year old girl stay strong through all of this? </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Of course she wasn&rsquo;t okay. She hated it when people asked her, because it definitely wasn&rsquo;t so. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">All Eliza could do was distract herself with the affairs of her family, but even that proved tiring and hard to cope with. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Eliza gritted her teeth. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c16 c17">It&rsquo;s so hard without you, Rose.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Eliza felt someone wrapping an arm around her. &ldquo;It seems I have a little substitute?&rdquo; said a hoarse voice that made her freeze. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Eliza slowly turned around and gasped. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&ldquo;R&hellip; Rose?&rdquo; she asked in disbelief. Rosalind stood there, her form being supported by a fancy cane. She looked a little weaker than usual, and her eyes lacked their usual energy, but it was undoubtedly Eliza&rsquo;s beloved older sister. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m back, Eliza,&rdquo; said Rosalind with a small smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to relieve you of all this work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rose!&rdquo; Eliza sprang from her chair, tempted to leap into her sister&rsquo;s arms, but she stopped short when her gaze fell on the cane. She approached her cautiously, hesitantly, as if afraid to hurt her. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I thought you&hellip; I thought you would never wake up&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s smile softened, and she reached out to take Eliza&rsquo;s trembling hand, her touch warm and steady. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for leaving you all alone,&rdquo; she said gently, her thumb brushing over Eliza&rsquo;s knuckles. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine how hard it&rsquo;s been. I&rsquo;m sure it wasn&rsquo;t easy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Eliza shook in place. &ldquo;I was so scared. Everyone&rsquo;s relying on me, but I&rsquo;m not&hellip; I&rsquo;m not as strong as you are, Rose. I tried, but I&rsquo;m not&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shh,&rdquo; Rosalind soothed, pulling her closer and cupping her tear-streaked face in one hand. Her thumb wiped away a stray tear as her smile grew, filled with pride and affection. &ldquo;I heard you&rsquo;ve been taking care of everything in my place,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how proud that makes me, Eliza. You&rsquo;ve been so brave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Eliza&rsquo;s resolve crumbled entirely, and she buried her face in Rosalind&rsquo;s dress, her small frame trembling with sobs. &ldquo;Thank you, Rose,&rdquo; she mumbled, her voice muffled against the fabric. &ldquo;But&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t want to be brave.&rdquo; Her fingers clutched at Rosalind&rsquo;s gown as if anchoring herself to her sister&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;I just wanted to see you again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Rosalind wrapped her arms around Eliza, holding her as tightly as her weakened state allowed. &ldquo;I know, Eliza,&rdquo; she whispered, resting her chin on top of Eliza&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c22" id="h.hf9gxnwipvmj"><span class="c21">Chapter 20 - Til Death Do Us Part</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c21 c17 c28">[Six months later]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rosalind walked towards the venue doors, her cane clinking on the ground. Her father was waiting there, holding out his hand to lead her to the altar.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; Rosalind nodded with a smile.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As they stood waiting for their cue, Rosalind&rsquo;s father sighed. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I still think this is too early&hellip; you&rsquo;re still healing from&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, father,&rdquo; Rosalind said, chuckling. &ldquo;I feel a lot better now. Even this cane is beginning to feel unneeded.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before he could finish, the doors began to creak open, and their cue arrived. The soft strains of instruments drifted into the antechamber, and all eyes turned toward them. It was already too late for her father to offer his apprehensions. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was time for Rosalind to get married. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They stepped forward, her cane tapping lightly on the carpeted floor. The hall was breathtaking, filled with radiant flower arrangements and golden ornaments. The aisle was lined with petals of every hue, leading to the altar where Francis stood waiting. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind felt her face grow warm upon seeing him, and avoided eye contact as they approached. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Every step seemed like a triumph, a culmination of her guilt, her efforts to overcome it, and the friendships she had reformed. As she walked, her gaze swept over the faces in the crowd. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She locked eyes with Beatrice, who gave her a brave nod. She saw Marciella and Prince Vicente, who looked at her with looks of respect. She found Melody, who flashed her an exaggerated grin and a cheeky wink, drawing a quiet laugh from Rosalind despite herself. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lastly, and most importantly, she saw her family&mdash;her mother dabbling at her eyes with a handkerchief, her overprotective brothers shifting uncomfortably in their tailored suits, and the little sister she loved so much, Eliza. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But today, Rosalind&rsquo;s main focus was on the man standing at the altar, his dark suit perfectly tailored, his expression filled with warmth and quiet resolve. The man who loved her even at her worst, who she was too blind to recognize, to appreciate. The one who had been her friend from the beginning, who gave her this precious second chance to be with everyone again. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When they reached the altar, Rosalind&rsquo;s father turned to face her. &ldquo;For a long time, I feared for you, Rosalind,&rdquo; he murmured quietly, his tone tinged with emotion. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve shown me that no mistakes can define who you are. You found a way to rise above who you used to be, and I&rsquo;m so proud of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tears shimmered in Rosalind&rsquo;s eyes, but she held them back, offering her father a soft, genuine smile. &ldquo;Thank you, Father. I couldn&rsquo;t have done this without all of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He gave her hand one last squeeze before placing it gently in Francis&rsquo;. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The exchange felt symbolic, as though he were entrusting Rosalind&rsquo;s happiness to a man he had come to respect deeply. Francis clasped her hand in his, his grip steady and reassuring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You look radiant,&rdquo; he whispered, his voice low but brimming with sincerity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s lips curved into a small, teasing smile. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not so bad yourself,&rdquo; she replied softly, earning a quiet laugh from him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The officiant stepped forward, draped in clean white robes. His presence brought everyone to silence. &ldquo;We stand here today, to celebrate a holy union,&rdquo; he began, his voice ringing clear in the echoing hall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The vows began, a series of formal questions and promises that bound their lives together. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind barely registered the words that followed; everything felt like a dream. Then, the officiant turned to her, his kind eyes meeting hers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rosalind Harcourt, do you take Francis Ashewood to be your wedded husband?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind took a deep breath, steadying her voice. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she began, her tone filled with quiet strength. &ldquo;I, Rosalind Harcourt, take Francis Ashewood to be my partner in all things. To share in your joys and bear your burdens. To stand by your side, no matter the trials we may face. You have been my strength when I felt weak, my light when I was at my very end. And today, I promise to be yours, for now and always.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A ripple of emotion passed through the crowd as she finished, her words hanging in the air with intensity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The officiant turned to Francis. &ldquo;And Francis Ashewood, do you take Rosalind Harcourt to be your wedded wife?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis&rsquo;s eyes never left hers as he spoke, his voice steady and charged with feeling. &ldquo;Yes. I, Francis Ashewood, take Rosalind Harcourt to be my wife. To honor and cherish you, to support you in all that you do. You have shown me what true determination and grace look like, and I vow to be worthy of you every day of my life. You are my heart, my home, and my future. More than that, you are my greatest miracle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind felt her heart swell at his words, a warmth spreading through her chest. She hadn&rsquo;t expected to feel so emotional at her own wedding, but hearing the depth of his words sent shivers through her entire body. How could she feel anything but happiness in that moment?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The officiant smiled, lifting his hands in blessing. &ldquo;Then, with the grace of our holy gods, I now pronounce you&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before he could finish, Rosalind surged forward, wrapping her arms around Francis and pulling him into a kiss. A collective gasp of surprise surged throughout the room, quickly followed by laughter and applause. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melody, seated in the front row, clutched her sides as she laughed. &ldquo;Have a little patience!&rdquo; she called out playfully. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t even finished!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Francis chuckled against Rosalind&rsquo;s lips, pulling back just enough to murmur, &ldquo;Impatient, are we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind grinned, her cheeks flushing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept you waiting long enough,&rdquo; she replied, her voice soft but unwavering.</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A few years later, Rosalind sat under the gazebo in the garden of the Ashewood Estate, overlooking the lavender flowers that grew around her. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As she sat taking in the outdoor air, she fiddled with her hands, humming to herself. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Bethany, her ever-dutiful maid, approached with a knowing smile, refilling Rosalind&#39;s teacup. &ldquo;Feeling restless?&rdquo; she asked, grinning.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Francis is just busy, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; Rosalind exclaimed, though the subject hadn&rsquo;t even been brought up in the first place. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not restless&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sure, my lady,&rdquo; Bethany said with a chuckle. &ldquo;But I must say, I&rsquo;ve seen so many new sides to you since we moved here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have no idea what you mean,&rdquo; Rosalind mumbled, turning away from her with a sip of her cup. Her cheeks were tinged with a faint pink hue. &quot;Now, be useful and bring out the extra tea set.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bethany tilted her head, curious. &quot;A special occasion?&quot; she asked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re having a special guest today,&rdquo; Rosalind replied with a smile, her expression softening. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a nod, Bethany set about retrieving a second tea set, arranging it meticulously. As she worked, she glanced over her shoulder. &ldquo;Is this an important guest?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind chuckled. &ldquo;Maybe you should ask her,&rdquo; she said, looking past the maid with a grin. &ldquo;Are you an important guest, Eliza?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bethany turned around, her eyes widening in surprise upon seeing Eliza approaching the gazebo. &ldquo;Lady Eliza!&rdquo; she exclaimed with a bow. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hello, Bethany!&rdquo; Eliza said with a smile. &ldquo;How&#39;s married life been treating my sister?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s happier than I&rsquo;ve ever seen her,&rdquo; Bethany said with a smile. &ldquo;Her and Duke Francis are always all over each other.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Rosalind cried with a blush. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to bring that up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eliza grinned. &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; she asked, sitting next to her. &ldquo;Father would cry if he heard that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind cleared her throat, eager to change the subject. &quot;How is everyone at home, anyway?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As fine as ever,&rdquo; Eliza replied, taking the offered teacup with a gracious nod. &ldquo;They always ask about you. Mother wonders if you&rsquo;re eating properly, and father&mdash;well, you know how he is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Some things never change,&rdquo; Rosalind said fondly, leaning back in her chair. &ldquo;And our brothers? Are they still working themselves to the bone?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eliza laughed, setting her cup down. &ldquo;Of course. They&rsquo;ve been engrossed in their studies ever since you left home.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind couldn&rsquo;t help but giggle at the familiar antics. &ldquo;And what about you? You haven&rsquo;t been causing trouble, have you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eliza placed a hand on her chest in mock offense. &ldquo;Me? Causing trouble? Never! I&rsquo;m a model daughter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bethany, still hovering nearby, stifled a laugh. &ldquo;Model daughters don&rsquo;t usually sneak out to spar with knights-in-training, Lady Eliza.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bethany!&rdquo; Eliza exclaimed, her cheeks turning a deep shade of pink. &ldquo;Who told you about that?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bethany grinned knowingly, shrugging as she picked up an empty tray. &ldquo;Just because I&rsquo;m no longer at the manor doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t hear things, Lady Eliza.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s eyes widened as she firmly set her teacup down. &quot;Eliza!&quot; she exclaimed, turning toward her sister in shock. &quot;Have you been learning swordplay?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well&hellip; yes, but&hellip;&rdquo; Eliza averted eye contact, fiddling with her gloves. &ldquo;Silke&rsquo;s been helping me&mdash;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Silke!&rdquo; Rosalind called sharply. The stoic knight appeared from the garden path, her expression sheepish. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, my lady?&rdquo; Silke said, her voice calm yet nervous. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind crossed her arms, her tone stern. &ldquo;Have you been subjecting my little sister to sword training behind my back?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lady Eliza wanted it, my lady,&rdquo; Silke muttered. &ldquo;I was just, er&hellip; following orders.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind sighed deeply, shaking her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t approve of this,&rdquo; she mumbled, though the look on Eliza&#39;s face began to weaken her resolve.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Come on, Rose!&rdquo; Eliza pleaded. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize how much I&rsquo;d enjoy it, but I really love swordfighting! Please let me continue training with Miss Silke!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind frowned, Eliza&rsquo;s pleading nearly convincing her. &ldquo;Have you been gentle with her?&rdquo; she asked, glancing at Silke. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silke uttered a rare chuckle. &ldquo;Swordplay isn&rsquo;t gentle, my lady.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind groaned, before glancing back at her sister. &quot;Alright,&quot; she relented with a sigh, her tone tinged with exasperation. &ldquo;You can continue, but&hellip; please be careful, Eliza.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eliza beamed, throwing her arms around Rosalind in an impulsive hug. &ldquo;Thank you, Rose! You won&rsquo;t regret this, I promise!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind patted Eliza on the back with a small smile. &ldquo;Just&hellip; don&rsquo;t make me regret this decision.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eliza flopped back into her chair, her usual cheerful smile returning. &ldquo;You worry too much, Rose,&rdquo; she said happily, taking a sip from her cup. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind sighed again, sipping her own tea as she tried to push away her gnawing concern. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better be,&rdquo; she muttered under her breath. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Enough about me!&quot; Eliza exclaimed, scooting her chair closer to Rosalind with an eager glint in her eye. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s been happening with you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; Rosalind echoed, a hint of bashfulness creeping into her tone. She fidgeted with the hem of her dress, avoiding her sister&rsquo;s penetrating gaze. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been&hellip; resting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Resting?&rdquo; Eliza&rsquo;s cheerful expression dissolved into one of concern. Her brows knitted together, and her voice dropped, laced with worry. &ldquo;Are you still facing side effects from the poison?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, nothing like that!&rdquo; Rosalind quickly interjected, shaking her head as a rosy blush grew on her cheeks. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the poison. I&rsquo;m fine. Truly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eliza relaxed slightly, though her suspicion lingered. &ldquo;Then what is it?&rdquo; she pressed, leaning closer. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another reason, isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind hesitated, her hand instinctively moving to rest over her stomach. A soft, almost shy smile spread across her face as she met her sister&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she admitted, her voice quiet. &ldquo;There is another reason.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eliza tilted her head in curiosity, her brow furrowing. Then, a sudden realization struck. Her eyes went wide, and her mouth fell open. &ldquo;Wait, you don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind&rsquo;s smile grew, her fingers gently tracing the fabric of her dress. &ldquo;Francis has given me my greatest miracle,&rdquo; she said, her voice soft.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For a moment, Eliza was silent in shock, processing the revelation. Then, with a delightful squeal, she sprung from her chair and captured Rosalind in a tight hug. &ldquo;Rose, I&rsquo;m so happy for you!&rdquo; she cried, her voice thick with emotion. &ldquo;So happy!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind held her close, overcome with a deep sense of happiness. How long had it been since she was able to relax and enjoy herself like this? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eliza clung to her, her face buried against Rosalind&rsquo;s shoulder. Quiet sobs escaped her lips, muffled but full of feeling. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be a mother,&rdquo; she murmured through tears, her voice trembling with delight. &ldquo;This is wonderful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rosalind laughed softly, rubbing her sister&rsquo;s hair with affection. &ldquo;Goodness, Eliza,&rdquo; she said, struggling to fight back her own tears. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re crying more than I am.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She glanced down, her gaze settling where her hands rested protectively over her stomach. Her smile widened, full of gratitude. Francis had already given her one miracle before, one that had saved her from despair. But now, he had given her another&mdash;one greater than she could have ever imagined.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And thankfully, this miracle was hers to nurture in peace.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c12 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
