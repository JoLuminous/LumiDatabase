Emiko often comes up with excuses whenever Saburo wants to hang out with her. Popular girl Ayane is dating the popular Naoto, but their relationship is rough. After discovering that Emiko is in a secret relationship with Naoto, Saburo runs away and finds himself on the school rooftop. There, he sees Ayane on the edge. She discovered their secret relationship as well, and is upset. Her entire life is full of misery and she has very few real friends (the ones she has are just taking advantage of her popularity). Saburo stops her from taking her life, and they form a friendship. As they grow closer in their shared sadness, Saburo constantly has to stop Ayane from making a terrible decision. But one day, Ayane greets Saburo on the rooftop with a small smile and invites him to lunch. From there, their new defiant secret relationship begins&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c23" id="h.gdhpi05ocdnp"><span class="c18 c13">Tags:</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c1">Depression, Slow Romance, Hurt/Comfort, Cheating, Broken Friendships, Hidden Personalities, Self Harm, Drama, Mature</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h3 class="c23" id="h.pz19e3bgof7"><span class="c13 c18">Preface</span></h3><p class="c7"><span class="c1">This story contains themes of depression, inferiority, and self-harm.

Sure, they were great friends in middle school, but something changed. Or maybe it would be more accurate to say </span><span class="c9 c11">someone</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c1">At the same time, he figured it wasn&rsquo;t as bad as he thought. They were just going through separate lives, the kind of difficulties everyone faces in long term relationships. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c1">Until he saw her kissing another guy. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c1">He couldn&rsquo;t get the sight out of his mind. The flickering lights, the rapid speed of the subway as it sped past them, the looks of love on their faces&hellip;</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c1">How long had it been since Emiko looked at him that way?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He wanted to believe it was a mistake. Maybe she had tripped and Naoto had caught her. Maybe they were talking about something innocent, and Saburo had seen it wrong&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But he definitely hadn&#39;t. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was there, watching every painful second, as Naoto leaned down, brushing his lips against hers. It had been soft, practiced&mdash;not the first time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo&rsquo;s stomach twisted, almost vomiting in the face of it all. With his heart cracked in two, he forced himself to climb the stairs. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The hallway was empty. Lunch break was almost over. On a typical day, before all of this happened&mdash;Saburo didn&rsquo;t even know when the infidelity started&mdash;he would have been sitting across from Emiko like always, enjoying simply being by her side. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, at some point he started pretending he didn&rsquo;t notice how little she looked at him anymore. Or how he couldn&rsquo;t feel the widening gap between them with each passing second. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was just brief discomfort, such feelings would fade with time as they considered the future, right? Perhaps she would look towards him again if he gave her space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo chuckled sourly. He had been a fool after all. If he had only realized things sooner, he could have prevented his own hurt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His feet carried him higher. He was at the door to the roof now, for reasons he didn&rsquo;t quite know. Was it to contemplate in peace? Or was he feeling like ending it all? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe not the latter. Saburo was too much of a coward to do something like that. He had always been. Emiko often reminded him of that fact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Saburo wasn&rsquo;t really thinking anymore. In that cafeteria, surrounded by countless students, sitting directly across from the one person he thought was his best friend, it was pure hell. He needed to be free of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He didn&#39;t even flinch as he pushed open the heavy metal door at the top of the stairwell and felt the cold wind slap his face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rooftop. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was off-limits, but the lock was broken. Nobody ever came up here. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At least, that was how it was supposed to be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo froze halfway through the doorway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Someone was already there.</span></p><hr><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A girl stood at the very edge of the rooftop, her back to him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane Shirasaki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He knew her name&mdash;it was impossible not to. Everyone knew her name. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane was the kind of girl who belonged on magazine covers or at the center of conversation. Long, glossy black hair cascaded down her perfectly fit uniform. Black tights stretched over long legs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was beautiful, but in a deceptively delicate way. There was something sharp about her&mdash;like she could cut you just by looking at you. No one dared insult her to her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stood perfectly still, arms loose at her sides.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ends of her shoes balanced dangerously on the edge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo&rsquo;s breath caught. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He knew what he was seeing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He knew exactly what she was about to do. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a brief second, he felt envious. Ayane wasn&rsquo;t like him, she wasn&rsquo;t afraid of such a thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He should respect her bravery and leave. He shouldn&rsquo;t get involved. This wasn&rsquo;t his business.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then a part of him asked a question he didn&rsquo;t want to ask: why was she doing it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane had everything; she was popular, attractive, and extremely loaded. Yet here she was, teetering before the end of it all. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A far part of his brain told him to walk away. But his mouth opened before he could stop himself. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane flinched.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a second, she didn&rsquo;t turn around. Saburo&rsquo;s heart slammed against his chest. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then&mdash;slowly&mdash;she glanced over her shoulder, eyes narrowed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Her voice was soft, flat. Not what he expected at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo blinked. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How could he answer her? He wasn&rsquo;t sure why he even said anything in the first place. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why did stop her? Was he being heroic? Or was it a selfish attempt at currying favor with the most popular girl in school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&hellip; I can see what you&rsquo;re doing,&rdquo; Saburo said finally, even though she obviously didn&rsquo;t need him to tell her that. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane&#39;s lips curved, but there was no warmth in it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; She tilted her head and gave him a teasing little smile. &ldquo;What does it look like then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo&#39;s throat tightened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He should walk away. He barely knew this girl. If he stopped her now, she&#39;d probably just call him a creep and tell him to mind his own business.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But he couldn&#39;t move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, he took a shaky step forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re&hellip;&rdquo; He frowned, unable to say it. &ldquo;You just shouldn&#39;t be up here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane&#39;s smile flickered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And you should?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He didn&#39;t have an answer to that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The wind howled between them, catching the edge of Ayane&#39;s skirt. Saburo&#39;s eyes flicked back to her shoes&mdash;just a few centimeters from the edge. She was far too close&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please&hellip;&rdquo; The word came out smaller than he&#39;d meant. He didn&rsquo;t even know why he was trying so hard in the first place. &ldquo;Don&#39;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a moment, Ayane just stared at him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Why not?&quot; She repeated, her voice painfully hollow. &ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo&#39;s heart raced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Countless meaningless phrases fluttered through his mind. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c11">&ldquo;Because someone will miss you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Would someone miss her? What if he hurt her without wanting to?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c9 c11">&ldquo;Because you don&#39;t deserve this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What did he even know about her? They hadn&rsquo;t even properly met until that very moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c9 c11">&ldquo;Because I don&#39;t want to watch anyone else disappear.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo didn&rsquo;t even know if he was that noble of a person. Those words were just as hollow as the expression on her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the end, none of those words would come out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, he blurted the only thing that did:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because&hellip;. I don&#39;t want to be the one who has to tell everyone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was such a stupid, awful thing to say. He wanted to punch himself the second it left his mouth. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But something flickered in Ayane&#39;s eyes&mdash;something dark and amused.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a second, Saburo thought she was going to laugh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, she stepped down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo released a breath he didn&rsquo;t even know he was holding as her feet hit solid concrete again. Ayane leaned back against the metal railing, crossing her arms over her chest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You really are pathetic, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo blinked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s the best excuse you could come up with? You&#39;re worried about the attention?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He opened his mouth&mdash;then closed it again, face burning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Relax. I wasn&#39;t actually gonna jump.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c9 c11">Liar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo didn&#39;t say it out loud, but the thought echoed in his head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had been one second away. He knew that look&mdash;he&#39;d seen it in the mirror this morning&mdash;and he was unknowingly wearing it right now. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane&#39;s eyes flicked over him, like she was sizing him up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So why are you up here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo held himself back. &ldquo;No reason.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane gave him a look of doubt. &ldquo;You have a girlfriend, don&rsquo;t you?

She always had one, but Saburo had never actually seen her smoke it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He wondered if she smoked for real&mdash;or if holding the cigarette was just something to do with her hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo scowled and looked away, heart settling into something that felt suspiciously like relief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a watchdog.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane smirked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You kind of are, though.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They fell into the same routine easily, like they&#39;d been meeting here for years instead of days.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo sat by the wall.

Breathe a little.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn&rsquo;t realize she had never learned how to just be until he sat next to her in the quiet corners of the school, in their hidden places, and didn&rsquo;t expect her to do anything but exist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For Ayane, there had only ever been thinking. Always calculating, always second-guessing. Wondering how people saw her, convinced that no one truly cared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But when she was with Saburo, the noise in her head quieted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And for the first time in her life, she wasn&rsquo;t just thinking&mdash;she was feeling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One afternoon, they sat together on the rooftop again, sharing a single can of coffee Ayane had bought from a vending machine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane tilted her head back, staring at the sky. &ldquo;You ever feel like everything&rsquo;s just&hellip;waiting to fall apart?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo glanced at her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her voice was light, but her grip on the soda can was tight enough to dent the aluminum.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He hesitated, then reached out, prying the can from her fingers and taking a sip. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane blinked at him. &ldquo;Did you just&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You were gonna crush it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She rolled her eyes but didn&rsquo;t take the can back. &ldquo;So?

She never called him over, never patted the ground, but she didn&rsquo;t have to. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was always there, whether she asked for him or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo started bringing canned coffee. He never made a big deal out of it, just set one down near her before settling in. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She never hesitated to take it, fingers wrapping around the metal with an unspoken familiarity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t know if she actually liked canned coffee. She was always drinking them, but that didn&rsquo;t mean anything. Still, she never complained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not that either of them said much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But silence had never been uncomfortable between them. It wasn&rsquo;t awkward or heavy. It just was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo let his gaze wander to the sky, exhaling softly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He wasn&rsquo;t sure when things started feeling like this&mdash;like something fragile, something they both instinctively knew not to touch too directly in case it shattered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He turned slightly, watching as Ayane idly peeled at the label on her can. Her movements were slow, methodical, like she was unraveling something only she could see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hadn&rsquo;t been smiling much lately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t mention it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, he leaned back against the concrete, letting his eyes slip shut for a moment. Up here, the world felt a little quieter. A little less cruel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beside him, Ayane shifted. He could feel her gaze before she even spoke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You look like you&rsquo;re thinking too hard again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo exhaled, taking another sip of coffee. &ldquo;I could say the same to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane frowned slightly, her voice light but distant. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really think about anything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He let out a small scoff. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c9 c11">Liar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c9 c11">You&rsquo;re always thinking. Always looking far away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo didn&rsquo;t call her out on the lie. There was no point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane wasn&rsquo;t the type to spill her thoughts just because someone asked. She guarded them too closely, tucked them away behind teasing remarks and lazy smiles that never quite reached her eyes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If he pushed, she&rsquo;d only retreat further.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, he didn&rsquo;t push.</span></p><hr><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wonder what it&rsquo;s like?&rdquo; Ayane asked suddenly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo frowned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Having someone like you unconditionally.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The question caught him off guard&mdash;mostly because Ayane&#39;s voice was too steady. Too casual. Like she didn&#39;t care about the answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo stared out at the city. The sun hung low in the sky, casting long shadows over the rooftops.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He often wondered the same thing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">Had</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;he ever truly known love? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or was he just drawn to Emiko because of their friendship?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It didn&#39;t feel like Emiko liked me that much at the end.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane snorted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&#39;s &#39;cause you were a spineless boyfriend.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo&#39;s head snapped toward her, half-offended&mdash;but Ayane just smirked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You think I don&#39;t notice how spineless you are?&rdquo; she drawled. &ldquo;You just let people walk all over you, Saburo.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo&#39;s chest squeezed tight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane&#39;s smirk sharpened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;See?

She always did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, no matter how much Saburo told her to take it seriously&mdash;to at least acknowledge that the rumors weren&rsquo;t harmless&mdash;she never did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She never flinched. Never snapped back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She just rolled her eyes, smirked like she had better things to worry about, and moved on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because Ayane was used to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo wasn&rsquo;t sure whether he admired that or not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because there was something unsettling about the way she carried on, unfazed, as if the rumors weren&rsquo;t even worth the effort of defending herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As if she had long since stopped expecting anyone to believe the truth.</span></p><hr><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He saw Emiko waiting by the school gates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo&rsquo;s stomach twisted, his steps slowing without thinking. Her long brown hair swayed slightly in the breeze, her fingers gripping the strap of her bag, her posture hesitant but firm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was waiting for him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo exhaled sharply through his nose, adjusting the strap of his own bag.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment her eyes met his, he felt a sharp pang in his chest&mdash;an old ache, dull but persistent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Emiko took a hesitant step forward. &ldquo;Saburo&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He turned on his heel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; Her voice was soft, but it still cut through the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo kept walking. His grip tightened and his heart pounded in his ears.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t want to hear whatever she had to say. Not now. Maybe not ever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because, deep down, he already knew what the conversation would be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hollow excuses, infuriating lies, and pointless apologies. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And he wasn&rsquo;t ready for it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe he never would be.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.inio9c2lxmsi"><span class="c6">Chapter 10 - Warning</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was late, and Ayane walked slowly, her hands shoved deep into the pockets of her jacket, the cool night air biting at her skin. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had been ignoring Naoto&#39;s messages for weeks, but tonight, she could feel him lurking in the back of her mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She knew he wouldn&rsquo;t just let it go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane just wasn&rsquo;t in the mood to face him. But then, just as she passed beneath one of the flickering street lamps, she saw him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naoto stood by the wall, leaning against it casually, his posture relaxed in a way that made Ayane&rsquo;s stomach turn. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was waiting for her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stopped, trying to mask the sudden surge of unease. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Her voice came out cold and bitter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naoto&rsquo;s lips twisted into a smirk, though there was no humor in it. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been ignoring me, Ayane. Thought you could get away with it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane averted his gaze. &ldquo;That was the idea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had tried to avoid him, hoping he&#39;d get the hint. But Naoto didn&rsquo;t take hints well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He pushed himself off the wall, his steps deliberate and measured as he closed the distance between them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he started, his tone falsely casual, &ldquo;you can screw around with him all you want. I don&rsquo;t care about that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand up. She knew exactly who he was talking about. Her stomach churned, but she kept her expression neutral.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naoto&rsquo;s voice dropped lower, the words now a threat, raw and bitter. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you dare become his girlfriend behind my back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane felt the weight of the words like a punch in the gut, but she gritted her teeth, refusing to let him see the crack in her composure. &ldquo;Who I become close with is none of your concern.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naoto&rsquo;s eyes narrowed, the smirk fading into something more dangerous. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s true. Are you dating him too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating. Ayane opened her mouth to respond, but before she could, he reached out and grabbed her arm. The grip was tight, possessive&mdash;like he was reminding her of her place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane jerked her arm away, but he didn&rsquo;t let go. &ldquo;Let go of me, Naoto,&rdquo; she said, trying to stay calm despite her shaking form.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naoto&rsquo;s smirk faded, replaced by something colder. He didn&rsquo;t seem to care how much she resisted. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get to make the rules anymore. You&rsquo;re still mine, Ayane.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words stung, more than they should have, but Ayane refused to show any weakness. Her mind raced, but all she could do was stare at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not yours,&rdquo; she spat, though her voice wavered slightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naoto&rsquo;s eyes narrowed, the anger in his gaze flickering just beneath the surface. Then, in one swift motion, he raised his hand and slapped her across the face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sound echoed in the empty courtyard, leaving Ayane standing there, stunned. Her cheek burned where his hand had connected, and for a split second, her vision blurred.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She blinked rapidly, the taste of metal in her mouth as she fought the tears threatening to spill. She found herself on the ground, looking up at him with an expression of sadness. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naoto didn&rsquo;t seem to care. He stood there, his face unreadable, the anger still simmering beneath the surface. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You think you can just walk away from me?&rdquo; he asked, his voice quieter now, but still laced with venom. &ldquo;You really think you can throw me away like that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane didn&rsquo;t reply immediately. She simply lay there, her body trembling slightly from the force of the slap, her cheek still stinging. She wanted to say something&mdash;anything&mdash;but the words wouldn&rsquo;t come.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She swallowed hard and looked him in the eye. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not yours, Naoto. Not anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His face twisted in anger, his fists clenching by his sides, but something darker flickered in his eyes&mdash;something that made her stomach drop, something more primal. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without a word, he raised his foot and kicked her hard in the ribs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The pain was immediate, sharp, and brutal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane cried out, feeling something break inside her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll regret this,&rdquo; he muttered, his hand balling into a fist. But instead of hitting her again, he just shoved past her, brushing her shoulder roughly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane stayed on the ground, her body aching from both the physical pain and the raw, hollow feeling in her chest. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her cheek still burned from the slap, her ribs throbbed with every shallow breath, and her thoughts were a whirlwind of confusion and rage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had never expected this&mdash;Naoto&rsquo;s possessiveness, him acting like she owed him anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she wasn&rsquo;t going back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she stood there, her breath unsteady, she felt a presence behind her. She didn&rsquo;t need to look to know who it was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He hadn&rsquo;t said a word, but his footsteps were slow and deliberate as he approached, like he was unsure whether to intrude. The moment Ayane heard him, she turned around quickly, blinking the sting out of her eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; Saburo asked, his voice soft, but the concern was clear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane nodded, but only half-heartedly. She didn&rsquo;t want to show him how much Naoto&rsquo;s words had affected her&mdash;how much they always affected her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she muttered, her voice sounding hollow even to her own ears. &ldquo;Just tired.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo didn&rsquo;t press her, but he didn&rsquo;t leave either. He simply extended his hand to her, the gesture both simple and kind. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without a word, Ayane let him help her up, feeling the weight of the night settle deeper into her bones, each step heavier than the last. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet, standing beside him&mdash;his quiet, solid presence&mdash;somehow made the sting of it all a little more bearable. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t ask what had happened. He didn&rsquo;t need to. Saburo just stood there, a quiet force in the dark, and that was enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here,&rdquo; Ayane said softly, nudging him gently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo glanced at her, his gaze soft but curious. &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane stared at the ground, feeling the weight of everything in the space between them. &ldquo;Anywhere.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They walked away, not looking back at Naoto, who was already disappearing into the shadows of the night. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They didn&rsquo;t look back. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They didn&rsquo;t need to. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naoto was already vanishing into the darkness, a shadow fading into nothingness, and they&mdash;Ayane and Saburo&mdash;were walking toward something else. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something that didn&rsquo;t belong to him.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.md7zlj316rkt"><span class="c13">Chapter 11 - One Step Away</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane and Saburo found themselves on the rooftop again that night, hands linked without either of them noticing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before Saburo could speak, Ayane pulled her hand away and walked to the edge, dangerously close to going over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ayane&mdash;&rdquo; Saburo&rsquo;s voice cracked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She froze. Her entire form was shaking, like it was on the brink of collapse. Her hand pressed against her side where Naoto had kicked her. Her hair hid her eyes as she stared down at the city lights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You heard everything, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo opened his mouth to say something, but the words felt stuck in his throat. He wasn&rsquo;t sure what to say to her&mdash;what could he say? He swallowed hard, then nodded. &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane let out a quick, dry laugh, her voice hollow. It wasn&rsquo;t a laugh of amusement, but one that spoke more of surrender. &ldquo;I guess I have nothing left to hide from you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her words hung in the air, heavy with resignation. Saburo&rsquo;s chest tightened, his feet taking slow, cautious steps toward her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ayane&hellip;&rdquo; His voice was soft, careful. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;WHY NOT?&rdquo; Her voice cracked, rising in desperation. She turned suddenly, her tears visible now, streaming down her face. &ldquo;Why do you care so much? Stop&hellip; stop pitying me&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words were rushed, as if the dam inside her had finally broken and she couldn&rsquo;t hold anything back anymore. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not obligated to care about me! Stop making it worse!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; Saburo interrupted. &ldquo;I just&mdash;&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t finish the sentence. He didn&rsquo;t know how to explain what he was feeling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before he knew it, he pulled her into a tight hug. She froze, then crumbled against him, shaking with silent sobs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn&rsquo;t fight him, didn&rsquo;t push him away. But she didn&rsquo;t speak either. She just cried, her shoulders trembling with the force of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t know what else to do, so he just held her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a long moment, Ayane pulled back slightly, her eyes red. She gazed up at him, her voice weak but with a hint of teasing. &ldquo;Saburo, do you realize how lucky you are?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the most popular girl in school under your thumb.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t done anything like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane smiled faintly. Then, slowly, she leaned into him, resting her head on his chest. &ldquo;You have,&rdquo; she murmured, barely audible, as if the words were too much to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo held her a little longer, feeling the weight of her sadness, but also a shift in the air as it eased. Ayane wasn&rsquo;t crying anymore, but the sadness still lingered in her posture, her body pressed against his, fragile yet grounded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She pulled back slightly, eyes red but softened. &ldquo;You&#39;re a real pain, you know that?&rdquo; she said, her voice hoarse, a smirk tugging at her lips.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane rolled her eyes before meeting his gaze. &ldquo;You make me talk about stuff I don&rsquo;t want to, like I don&rsquo;t have enough problems already.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo smiled, grateful for the attempt at humor. &ldquo;Sorry. I don&rsquo;t want to make things worse.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She shrugged, still tense. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like you have a choice. You&rsquo;re stuck with me now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo chuckled. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m okay with that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane tilted her head, eyes narrowing. &ldquo;Are you sure? I&rsquo;m a mess. One of these days, you&rsquo;ll probably run away screaming.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d let me,&rdquo; he replied, his tone serious enough to make her pause. It wasn&rsquo;t a joke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her gaze softened, the teasing fading. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re weird,&rdquo; she muttered, no malice, just something resigned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They stayed there together, both of them still dealing with their own darkness, but for the first time in a while, it didn&rsquo;t feel like it was too much to bear. At least, not tonight.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.ha7c623ze6sl"><span class="c13">Chapter 12 - Feeling Alive</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane and Saburo sat side by side on the rooftop, the late afternoon sun dipping into warm hues. The wind carried the scent of spring, something fresh, something new.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She nudged the extra coffee can he&rsquo;d brought, her fingers brushing his. &ldquo;You keep doing this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo tilted his head. &ldquo;Doing what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bringing me coffee without asking.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You drink it every time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane huffed, but there was no bite to it. She popped the tab open and took a sip. &ldquo;Still. What if one day I say no?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo smirked. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d drink it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Of course you would.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Silence settled, but not the kind that suffocated. It stretched between them, easy and unforced. Their shoulders touched, just barely. Neither moved away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane kicked at a loose pebble near her feet, watching as it skittered across the pavement before settling into the cracks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Saburo?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She hesitated, her nails pressing into the fabric of her sleeves, gripping her arms tighter than necessary. &ldquo;Forget about last night.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo stopped walking for a moment, his brow furrowing. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane kept her gaze down, shifting her weight from one foot to the other. &ldquo;Just... forget about it. It doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo didn&rsquo;t answer right away. He studied her, the way her shoulders hunched slightly, the way her voice flattened in that practiced, indifferent way she used when she wanted to avoid something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She sighed, rubbing her arm. &ldquo;Because Naoto&rsquo;s words aren&rsquo;t worth listening to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo exhaled sharply through his nose, shoving his hands into his pockets. &ldquo;Maybe not. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I should pretend none of it happened.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane tilted her head slightly, finally looking at him. &ldquo;Can you at least forget the worst parts?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He considered that for a moment before glancing at her out of the corner of his eye. &ldquo;Can I still remember what happened after?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane blinked, then smirked. &ldquo;If you want to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo gave a small nod, his lips curving into something that wasn&rsquo;t quite a smile, but close. He rocked back on his heels, his expression thoughtful. &ldquo;If I was brave enough&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered, almost to himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; Ayane tilted her head, waiting for him to finish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo clenched his fists, flexing his fingers before shoving them back into his pockets. &ldquo;If I was brave enough, I&rsquo;d give Naoto a taste of his own medicine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a second, Ayane just stared at him, then&mdash;before she could stop herself&mdash;she laughed. A real laugh, not the empty, bitter one she often used as a defense. This one came easily, freely, as if it had been waiting for the right moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She grinned, shaking her head. &ldquo;God, I&rsquo;d love to see that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo smirked. &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Ayane kicked at another pebble, her smirk lingering. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t force yourself. You&rsquo;re too much of a coward for that, aren&rsquo;t you, Saburo?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo sighed, long and dramatic. &ldquo;...You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane chuckled. &ldquo;Of course, I, on the other hand, wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate. One of these days, I&rsquo;m gonna kick that bastard so hard between the legs he won&rsquo;t be able to sleep around anymore. Not without his precious piece.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo shuddered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She said it with so much conviction that it gave him goosebumps. Worse, she looked completely at ease&mdash;playful, not weighed down by exhaustion or sorrow. For once, she wasn&rsquo;t hiding behind a smirk. She looked&hellip; alive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">His chest tightened. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re </span><span class="c9">scary</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;when you talk like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; She leaned back on her hands. &ldquo;Maybe I like being </span><span class="c9">scary</span><span class="c1">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo stretched out his legs. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re scary.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane scoffed. &ldquo;You should.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He turned his coffee in his hands, watching the liquid inside swirl. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re just trying not to get hurt.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her smirk faltered. She stared at him, lips parting slightly as if to argue. But she didn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, she let out a short, breathy laugh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re annoying, Saburo.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve mentioned that before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She laughed again&mdash;another genuine laugh. A real, unguarded laugh that made his stomach flip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo wanted to bottle that sound and keep it for the nights when everything felt heavy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane wiped at her eyes, shaking her head. &ldquo;God. I must be losing it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo grinned. &ldquo;If you are, then I am too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looked at him then, studying his face. The warmth in her gaze made his throat go dry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For one perfect moment, neither of them felt broken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their touches lingered longer than before&mdash;fingers brushing against coffee cans, knees pressing together. He didn&rsquo;t move away. Neither did she.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo had always known how her hands felt in his. He&rsquo;d held them before, after all. But this was different. This was deliberate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His heartbeat stuttered. He thought about kissing her again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane sighed and leaned her head on his shoulder. &ldquo;...I don&rsquo;t want to die anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His breath caught. He turned his head slightly, catching the way her eyes fluttered shut.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You mean that?&rdquo; he asked quietly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She nodded, almost imperceptibly. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Relief flooded his chest, so strong it almost hurt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He swallowed. &ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She shifted, tilting her head up just enough to look at him. Her face was inches from his, close enough that he could see every detail&mdash;the slight part of her lips, the way her lashes trembled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He hoped maybe she thought about kissing him again too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she didn&rsquo;t move, and neither did he.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, he exhaled, slow and steady, and let his head rest gently against hers.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.g702p8eyduin"><span class="c13">Chapter 13 - Maelstrom</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe Saburo and Ayane thought they had weathered the first wave, that it had finally faded into nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe they had convinced themselves that no one cared enough to keep watching.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the truth was, the world always noticed when broken people started putting each other back together.</span></p><hr><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo barely made it through the school gates before the whispers started.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c9 c11">&ldquo;Hey, isn&rsquo;t that him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9 c11 c12">&ldquo;The one Ayane&rsquo;s been dragging around?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c9 c11">&ldquo;I swear, he follows her everywhere.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He exhaled sharply, keeping his head down as he wove through the hallways. It was worse today. The air buzzed with attention, thick with speculation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">People must have noticed the changes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane was smiling more. Her laughter wasn&rsquo;t sharp-edged or hollow anymore. And most of all&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A light tap on his shoulder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Saburo,&rdquo; her voice came from behind, steady and sure. &ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He turned, and there she was&mdash;bright-eyed, alive in a way she hadn&rsquo;t been before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This had become their new routine. Ever since Ayane had chosen to keep living, she had started seeking him out beyond the rooftop. Greeting him in the mornings. Meeting him in the hallways.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And frankly, Saburo didn&rsquo;t know what to make of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He liked seeing her. That much was undeniable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now, so did everyone else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the rumors had returned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second wave was worse than the first.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c9 c11">&ldquo;So they really are friends.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c9 c11">&ldquo;Friends? Yeah, right. She&rsquo;s probably using him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c9 c11">&ldquo;Him? What would she need a weakling like that for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c9 c11">&ldquo;You know </span><span class="c9 c11">how the popular</span><span class="c9 c11">&nbsp;</span><span class="c9 c11">ones</span><span class="c12 c9 c11">&nbsp;are. They always need a little&hellip; side action.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was disgusting, the things people said about them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo clenched his jaw, fingers curling into fists. He wanted to say something. He wanted to push back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">But was he brave enough to confront them?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, he was not.</span></p><hr><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo kept walking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kept his head down. Kept his mouth shut.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was easier that way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Let them talk. Let them sneer. Let them twist their words like knives, cutting at something they didn&rsquo;t even understand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He told himself it didn&rsquo;t matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Except it did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because Ayane heard it too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She never said anything about it, but Saburo saw the way her fingers twitched when she caught wind of their voices. The way her jaw tightened, the way her usual smirks lost their sharpness for just a fraction of a second.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They didn&rsquo;t see her face after the whispers reached her ears. But he did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And it bothered him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You ever wonder why people can&rsquo;t just mind their own business?&rdquo; Ayane said, falling into step beside him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn&rsquo;t comment directly on the murmurs, didn&rsquo;t acknowledge them at all. But her voice was lighter than usual&mdash;too light, forced. A carefully constructed mask, one he recognized all too well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;All the time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She scoffed, shaking her head. &ldquo;They talk like they know us. Like they understand anything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">They reached her locker, and she twisted in the combination, yanking it open with more force than necessary. A loose note fell out, reading &ldquo;Use me next!&rdquo; and she crumbled it with a sharp </span><span class="c9">sigh</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Does everyone think I&rsquo;m easy now?&rdquo; She hissed, tossing the gross note into a nearby trash can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know you,&rdquo; Saburo muttered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane stilled for a fraction of a second before glancing at him. &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he said, voice steady. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know you at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She watched him carefully, expression unreadable. Then she smiled and hit him playfully on the shoulder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you can say things like that, why don&rsquo;t you try fighting back for once?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo shrugged. &ldquo;You make it sound easy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane chuckled&mdash;a real chuckle, not the hollow kind she threw around to keep people from digging too deep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was small. Barely anything at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it was enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For now, at least.</span></p><hr><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the time lunch rolled around, Saburo was already exhausted. He walked up the stairs to the rooftop, only to stop short when he heard voices&mdash;voices that weren&rsquo;t Ayane&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so obvious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll use him like she did the others.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Or maybe he likes it? Just another pathetic guy wrapped around her finger.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laughter followed, sharp and cruel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo turned the corner, stepping into view. The girls at the stairwell froze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; one of them murmured, smirking. &ldquo;Speak of the devil.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo met their gazes, his expression unreadable. He should say something. Defend Ayane. Defend himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But nothing came out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so serious,&rdquo; another girl giggled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just telling the truth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo finally forced his mouth to open. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know anything about Ayane.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh? But everyone sees it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re her new toy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Another laugh. Another smirk. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo knew he couldn&rsquo;t keep running away. He had to be brave, just once. Just this once.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not her toy,&rdquo; He said confidently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m her friend. Her only friend.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Her only friend?&rdquo; One of the girls giggled again. &ldquo;Ayane has many friends, but a loser like you is certainly not one of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo glared. &ldquo;But would you three know anything about that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The three girls reacted in offense. &ldquo;What? Of course Ayane is friends with us! That&rsquo;s why a loser like you has no place near her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm&hellip;&rdquo; Saburo tilted his head. &ldquo;But Ayane has never mentioned you before. What were your names again?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wh&ndash;!&rdquo; They glared at him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll just be thrown aside anyway! Hmph!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just like that, they were gone, brushing past him like he was nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo stood there for a long moment before heading up the final steps.</span></p><hr><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When he finally stepped out onto the roof, Ayane was already there&mdash;perched on the ledge with her knees drawn up, an unsmoked cigarette dangling from her fingers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She glanced over her shoulder at the sound of the door&mdash;eyes flicking down to the coffee cans in his hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Took you long enough, loser.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo walked over slowly, feeling the heat still burning under his skin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He passed her a can without a word.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane took it without looking at him, cracking the tab with one thumb.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a few minutes, everything was the same as always&mdash;just the two of them, the wind, the faint burn of cigarette smoke in the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Saburo couldn&#39;t stop hearing those voices in his head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Couldn&#39;t stop picturing those smirks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ayane&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His voice came out rougher than he meant it to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane glanced at him lazily&mdash;eyes half-lidded, the way they always were when she was trying to pretend she didn&#39;t care about anything. Though, it wasn&rsquo;t as bad as it usually was. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo&#39;s throat tightened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He wanted to tell her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He wanted to warn her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the words tangled up in his chest&mdash;too heavy, too sharp.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane wrapped an arm around his shoulder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Somebody say something about me again?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo flinched.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She always knew.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course she knew.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; he mumbled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane huffed out a bitter laugh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let them talk, Saburo. It doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Liar.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo cupped his mouth shut. The words spilled out before he could stop them, causing Ayane to freeze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first he thought she was going to yell at him, angry at what he said. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But instead she grinned and leaned against his shoulder. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You actually talked back to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stop saying what you don&rsquo;t mean,&rdquo; Saburo snapped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m upset because you refuse to be.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane smiled sadly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve certainly gotten bold.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo gritted his teeth. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; he said angrily. &ldquo;I hate how they lie about you, Ayane.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane smiled sadly and leaned in close&mdash;close enough that Saburo could smell coffee on her breath, close enough that her hair brushed against his cheek.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&#39;re sweet, Saburo,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;But if you think this world gives a shit about what&#39;s true... you&#39;re dumber than you look.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo&#39;s chest ached.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She pulled back, flicking ash over the edge of the roof.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, so soft he almost didn&#39;t hear it, she added:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...They&#39;ll come after you too, you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo&#39;s heart clenched.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn&#39;t warning him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was giving him an out&mdash;one last chance to walk away before the world sank its teeth into both of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He could have taken it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He should have taken it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, he reached out&mdash;slow, careful&mdash;and plucked the unused cigarette from her fingers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane blinked at him in faint surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo stubbed it out against the wall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then he leaned close&mdash;close enough that she could see the heat burning behind his eyes, close enough that there was no mistaking what he was about to say.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let them come.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">For one long, breathless second, Ayane just stared at him.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Then&mdash;so soft he almost missed it&mdash;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">She smiled.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Saburo&hellip;&rdquo; She leaned against his shoulder and closed her eyes. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Her voice was quiet, but Saburo heard every word. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">He pulled her close. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to thank me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Time passed as they sat in silence, simply enjoying each other&rsquo;s presence. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Then Ayane broke the silence, whispering in his ear. &ldquo;Wanna do it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wanna do it?&rdquo; she repeated.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a coward now,&rdquo; Ayane whispered, planting her lips on his own. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking this seriously.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why me?&rdquo; Saburo asked, looking away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never even&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re cute,&rdquo; she said, cutting him off. Then, her cheeks tinged with pink, she added, &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...are you sure?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Ayane chuckled softly and planted her lips on his own. &ldquo;Definitely.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.dmwi7fk3yt4o"><span class="c13">Chapter 14 - Ambiguous </span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane&rsquo;s apartment was cold.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not in temperature, but in feeling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo glanced around as he stepped inside. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The space was large, expensive, and pristine, yet it lacked warmth. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No clutter, no mess. No framed photos on the walls, no stray belongings left behind in a rush. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the kind of place that looked lived-in only because someone insisted it should be, not because it truly was. It felt more like a display room than a home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane tossed her bag onto the couch and stretched. &ldquo;Welcome to my grand palace,&rdquo; she said dryly, gesturing vaguely around them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo followed her deeper inside, taking in the sterile neatness. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; big.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane snorted. &ldquo;You can just say it&rsquo;s lifeless. I won&rsquo;t be offended.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He hesitated. &ldquo;You live here alone?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A small smirk tugged at her lips, but it didn&rsquo;t reach her eyes. &ldquo;Most of the time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wandered toward the kitchen, pulling two cans from the fridge before tossing one his way. &ldquo;Coffee?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He caught it easily, pressing his fingers into the cold metal. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane cracked hers open, leaning against the counter as she took a sip. Her gaze lingered on him&mdash;sharp, assessing. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re awfully quiet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo hesitated before speaking. &ldquo;I just&hellip; didn&rsquo;t expect you to be&hellip; rich.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her expression didn&rsquo;t shift, but something in her gaze dimmed, like a light flickering just before it goes out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, well.&rdquo; She took another sip. &ldquo;Being rich isn&rsquo;t as great as it sounds.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He sat down on the couch, watching as she joined him. They drank in silence for a while, the bitter taste of coffee filling the space between them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, at some point, silence turned into something else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something heavier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something inevitable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The coffee was set aside.</span></p><hr><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t Saburo&rsquo;s first kiss, but it was the first one that made him forget where he was. The first one that felt like falling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane&rsquo;s lips were soft, familiar yet unfamiliar, her touch lingering in a way that made his pulse stutter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t desperate. It wasn&rsquo;t rushed. It just was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her hands found their way under his shirt, tracing warmth against his skin. Saburo shuddered. He wasn&rsquo;t sure when his own hands had started moving, but they were now at her waist, pulling her closer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All of this was new to him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He followed Ayane&rsquo;s lead, but she wasn&rsquo;t demanding, wasn&rsquo;t forceful. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She let the moment dictate its own rhythm, and somehow, it was perfect that way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They weren&rsquo;t in love&mdash;at least, they didn&rsquo;t seem to be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But they weren&rsquo;t careless either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They moved as though they had already memorized each other&rsquo;s bodies, as though understanding had been carved into their bones long before this night.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Somewhere between breathless kisses and tangled limbs, Ayane whispered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">So he didn&rsquo;t.</span><hr></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was quiet when they finished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The night had stretched into something slow and weightless, the sounds of the city fading into the distance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They sat side by side on the bed, barely dressed, sharing their coffees again like nothing had changed&mdash;except, of course, everything had.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their shoulders touched for reasons neither of them tried to name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a long time, neither spoke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, Saburo exhaled. &ldquo;&hellip;So.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane tilted her head slightly, watching him from the corner of her eye.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are we?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn&rsquo;t answer right away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she finally said. &ldquo;You tell me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo hesitated. &ldquo;Surely&hellip; we&rsquo;re more than just&hellip;&rdquo; He trailed off, unable to find the right words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane smirked, her voice laced with something teasing, something unreadable. &ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;re what some might call &lsquo;fuck-buddies&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo flinched at the bluntness. &ldquo;Ayane&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She just hummed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He turned to her fully now, his expression serious. &ldquo;Do you&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before he could finish, she placed a finger against his lips.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to give you an answer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo swallowed. &ldquo;So&hellip; that&rsquo;s it? We&rsquo;re just&hellip; ambiguous?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane laid her head against his shoulder, exhaling softly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better than nothing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo exhaled through his nose, staring at the ceiling. His body still felt warm where Ayane had touched him, but his mind was tangled, lost in the haze of something neither of them dared to name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Better than nothing, huh?&rdquo; he murmured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane nodded against his shoulder. &ldquo;Mm.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He hesitated before speaking again. &ldquo;That sounds... lonely.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane huffed a soft laugh, but it lacked humor. &quot;Maybe. But loneliness is familiar. It&rsquo;s safe.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo frowned. &ldquo;Is that all I am to you? Something safe?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was quiet for a long moment. Then, in a voice so soft he almost missed it, she admitted, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo&#39;s heart skipped. &ldquo;Then what am I?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane didn&#39;t move, didn&#39;t lift her head. Instead, she reached for his hand, lacing her fingers with his. &ldquo;You&#39;re&hellip;&rdquo; She hesitated, then sighed. &ldquo;You make things complicated, Saburo.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Complicated how?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You make me want things I shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo turned his head slightly, trying to see her face. &ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane let out a dry chuckle. &ldquo;Like this.&quot; She squeezed his hand lightly, then let go. &ldquo;Like staying.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A strange ache settled in his chest. &ldquo;...You don&rsquo;t have to leave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She finally lifted her head, meeting his gaze with something unreadable. &ldquo;And then what? We pretend this means nothing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Does it?&rdquo; Saburo asked, voice steady.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane&#39;s lips parted slightly, but no words came.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because it doesn&#39;t feel like nothing to me,&rdquo; he admitted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her expression faltered, her carefully built walls cracking just a little. &ldquo;Saburo&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They fell into silence again, the weight of unspoken things still lingering between them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps what they were didn&rsquo;t need to be said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not yet, at least.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.pp2n3ri4rgzb"><span class="c13">Chapter 15 - Unabashed </span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rumors weren&rsquo;t finished with them yet. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, things had become worse seemingly overnight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By lunchtime the next day, whispers were everywhere.</span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c12 c9 c11">&ldquo;Have you seen how Ayane smiles these days?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c9 c11">&ldquo;Frankly, it&rsquo;s a little gross.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c9 c11">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s so two-faced!

The murmurs pressed in from all directions, suffocating. It was nothing new&mdash;he had been invisible for so long, nothing but background noise to his classmates. But now, suddenly, everyone had an opinion about him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">About </span><span class="c12 c9 c11">them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He glanced up at Ayane. She was eating as if nothing was wrong, movements fluid, expression unreadable.

So why wouldn&rsquo;t you do it to him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo clenched his fists under the table.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane let out a hum, tilting her head further. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s cute,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You think you know me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The girl scoffed. &ldquo;Everyone does.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Funny.&rdquo; A beat of silence. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know you. But here you are, running your mouth like we&rsquo;re best friends.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She leaned in, voice dropping to something softer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What was your name again?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The girl opened her mouth. Nothing came out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thought so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane straightened, sipping her coffee. &ldquo;I could tear you apart right now, you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The girl flinched.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane stepped closer, her smile never wavering. &ldquo;See, here&rsquo;s the thing,&rdquo; she murmured, her voice dipping into something quieter. &ldquo;You can call me whatever you want. A user. A slut. A monster. If that makes you feel better about yourself, go ahead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She tilted her head the other way, her eyes glinting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But Saburo?&rdquo; Her tone sharpened, slicing through the air. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get to talk about him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The girl recoiled like she&rsquo;d been slapped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got a problem, then say it to me. But don&rsquo;t you dare act like he&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo; Ayane&rsquo;s voice softened again, but there was something in it now&mdash;something razor-thin and dangerous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Because unlike you, he&rsquo;s never needed to tear someone else down to feel important.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The girl&rsquo;s face burned red. &ldquo;I&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But you did.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane cocked her head, her smile stretching just a little wider.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And you want to know what&rsquo;s really funny?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No response.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The girl had nothing left to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane&rsquo;s expression darkened, all traces of amusement gone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Saburo is the only one in this entire fucking school who&rsquo;s unconditionally on my side.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The air was suffocating.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No one moved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No one even dared to breathe too loudly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo gritted his teeth, his grip tightening around the splintered remains of his chopsticks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was defending him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not ignoring it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not brushing it off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not laughing it away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Defending him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His throat tightened. &ldquo;Ayane&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned to him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, in front of everyone&mdash;without hesitation&mdash;she laced her fingers through his.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo&rsquo;s breath caught.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her grip was firm. Warm. Unshaken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She smirked. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind being my dog, do you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was teasing. Playful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in her eyes, there was something more&mdash;something defiant, something unapologetic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo exhaled through his nose. Slowly, he let his fingers tighten around hers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re the one calling me,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;then I don&rsquo;t mind at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gasps rippled through the cafeteria.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The girl who had spoken shrank in her seat, face burning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, one by one, the murmurs returned&mdash;this time, not about Saburo.</span></p><hr><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo let out a breath he hadn&rsquo;t realized he was holding. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to do that,&rdquo; he muttered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane raised an eyebrow, settling back into her seat. &ldquo;You wanted me to let them keep talking?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No. I just&hellip;&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to keep coming after you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane shrugged. &ldquo;Let them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo exhaled through his nose. &ldquo;You make it sound so easy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She set down her fork and leaned forward. &ldquo;Saburo.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He met her gaze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">&ldquo;Do </span><span class="c9 c11">you</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;think I&#39;m using you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He blinked. &ldquo;What? No.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Then why does it matter what they say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">Saburo pressed his lips together, fingers tightening around his tray. &ldquo;Because it </span><span class="c9 c11">does</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;matter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her expression softened. &ldquo;To them. Not to me. And not to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane sighed, then smirked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be a villain than a victim.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo scoffed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s messed up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; She leaned her chin on her hand. &ldquo;At least villains get to decide their own stories.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He shook his head, exasperated. &ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t care, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She twirled a piece of her hair around her finger, smirking. &ldquo;Oh, I care.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo stared at her, confused. &ldquo;...Then why are you smiling?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane tilted her head, her expression shifting&mdash;something rare, something unguarded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A real smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bright. Unshaken.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Full of complexity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re angry </span><span class="c9">for</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.yd2g87llmt4c"><span class="c13">Interlude - No More Cowardice </span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For as long as he lived, Saburo was a coward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He felt certain ways about certain things, certain people, certain situations. But he had never been brave enough to say any of it out loud. The words always stuck in his throat like a wad of cotton, suffocating him just enough to stay silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo didn&rsquo;t really care one way or another. He figured his cowardice was a part of himself, something he couldn&rsquo;t change. It was just the way things were. Some people were strong, loud, unafraid to take up space in the world. He wasn&rsquo;t one of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a while, he believed that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even when his only friend, Emiko, cheated on him, he couldn&rsquo;t do anything. He didn&rsquo;t scream at her, didn&rsquo;t demand answers, didn&rsquo;t let the rage inside him take over. He let it happen. He let himself be walked over. And when she left him behind like an afterthought, he let himself be alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was who he was. Always going to be a coward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But all of that changed when he met Ayane Shirasaki.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first, her blunt words upset him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had a way of speaking that felt like a scalpel cutting through flesh, exposing the nerves underneath. It was like she could see straight through him, right into the weakness he tried so hard to hide.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But quickly, he realized she wasn&rsquo;t doing it to hurt him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was helping him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe she was just like him. Perhaps it was easier to point out everyone else&rsquo;s faults than acknowledge her own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Saburo came to know her, he realized Ayane was a deeply complex person. She felt sadness, she felt fear, she felt pain&mdash;just like anyone else. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was not untouchable, not as invincible as she pretended to be. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Beneath the sharp exterior, she was someone who had been hurt too many times, someone who had learned to strike first before the world could wound her again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Saburo wanted to protect her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He wanted to stop others from spouting lies about her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He wanted to show her ungrateful boyfriend, Naoto, a piece of his mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, he couldn&rsquo;t find the courage to be the one to stand beside her when she needed it most.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo wasn&rsquo;t stupid. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He knew what she was facing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The whispers in the hallway, the way people looked at her like she was something to be avoided, something to be feared. He knew she was the subject of cruel gossip, the scapegoat for everyone&rsquo;s insecurities and petty frustrations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And she was right&mdash;if anyone was going to fight back against them, it had to be her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that didn&rsquo;t make it okay. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo&rsquo;s stomach twisted with guilt every time he thought about how he had stood silently by, watching her fend for herself. He didn&rsquo;t want to be a bystander anymore. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not when it was her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still, his fear lingered, crawling into the corners of his mind, telling him that speaking out, even defending Ayane, would be the same as making himself a target. He couldn&rsquo;t risk it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So he stayed quiet. He always stayed quiet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Ayane wasn&rsquo;t quiet, was she? She would never sit back and let someone talk behind her back, let someone undermine her, let someone think she was weak. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn&rsquo;t care what they thought of her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Saburo? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was a coward. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A coward who was afraid of what people might say about him if he took a stand. He was scared of being exposed, scared of being seen, and above all, scared of failing her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that was the problem&mdash;he already was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was already failing her by staying silent, by not taking that first step forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo clenched his fists, feeling the familiar weight of his cowardice settle like a stone in his chest. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There had been so many moments&mdash;so many small chances when Ayane needed someone, and he just stayed there, rooted to the spot, too afraid to move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this time&hellip; this time, he wouldn&rsquo;t let it happen again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had to change.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He wasn&rsquo;t sure how, but for the first time in his life, Saburo realized something: cowardice wasn&rsquo;t a part of him, it was something he had allowed to shape him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And now, for Ayane&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t going to let it control him any longer.</span></p><hr><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ayane&hellip;&rdquo; His voice was quiet, hesitant, but she looked at him anyway, her eyes sharp and knowing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I want to change.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane leaned against him, crossing her arms. &ldquo;Why should you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo clenched his fists, thinking back to all of the rumors, the whispers, the cruel nicknames.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;People will never stop talking about us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not unless I&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Give me a good reason, Saburo.&rdquo; Ayane leaned into his face, narrowing her eyes. &ldquo;Why do you want to change?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo opened his mouth, then hesitated. Why? Why did he want to be different? Was it just for the rumors? To clear his own name?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No. That wasn&rsquo;t it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was her. It had always been her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I want to be able to protect you, Ayane.&rdquo; The words came out in a rush, his heart pounding. &ldquo;I want to be strong enough to take care of you for the rest of your life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo covered his mouth. He didn&rsquo;t mean to say all of that. He barely even knew where it had come from.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane stared at him, her eyes wide. Then, slowly, a small smile spread across her lips. A real one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her cheeks turned pink, and before he could say anything else, she leaned her head against his shoulder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good answer,&rdquo; she whispered.</span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.ch8we1i2thsh"><span class="c13">Chapter 16 - One Step Forward </span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was late one afternoon when Saburo made his way across the school courtyard, his footsteps echoing in the quiet space. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He approached a particular group of girls, a trio who were known across the school for their love of gossip. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their entire reputation revolved around the whispers they spread and the rumors they fed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anything that could be twisted into something scandalous was a treasure to them, and they never hesitated to pass along the juiciest details.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo had never really talked to them before, never had a reason to. But today was different. Today, he was ready to change things, even if it meant stepping out of his comfort zone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, you girls love gossip, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">The three girls turned toward him, their eyes lighting up with interest at the sudden attention. Their </span><span class="c9">grins</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;were wide, expectant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, so what?&rdquo; one of them asked, her voice laced with curiosity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo smirked, the feeling of power&mdash;however small&mdash;filling him as he leaned in slightly, lowering his voice just enough to draw them in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something interesting you might want to check out.&rdquo; He pulled out his phone and showed them a photo, which captured a certain late-night affair at the subway station. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The girls gasped, their eyes growing wide with excitement as they leaned in closer. One of them stared at him, sizing him up with newfound curiosity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name again?&rdquo; she asked, still holding her phone out, the photo already saved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Saburo,&rdquo; he replied smoothly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Ayane&rsquo;s new boyfriend. And those two in the photo&hellip; I think you know who they are.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A shocked silence fell over them for a moment. Then, just as quickly, their grins widened even more, if that was even possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re&mdash;?&rdquo; one of them started, but they didn&rsquo;t need to finish. Their laughter began to bubble up, eager and hungry for more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Tell us everything you know!&rdquo; they chorused in unison.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo gave a small, satisfied nod, his lips curling into a grin of his own. This was just the beginning. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had set the stage, and now, the rumors would spread like wildfire.</span></p><hr><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Later that afternoon, Saburo found himself sitting at a bus stop, his phone in one hand, a can of coffee in the other. The sky above was a muted gray, the sun barely visible behind the clouds, but his mind was far from the weather.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He glanced at his phone screen. 3:00 p.m.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a typical after-school hour, the time when the world seemed to pause for a moment before everything picked back up again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His thumb hovered over the screen as a message from Ayane popped up.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c13">Ayane</span><span class="c1">: How&rsquo;s it going?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo smiled as his fingers danced across the screen. They had exchanged phone numbers not long ago, a sign of their growing connection.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c13">Saburo</span><span class="c1">: Good. You heard the rumors, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A few seconds passed before Ayane&rsquo;s reply appeared.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c13">Ayane</span><span class="c1">: Yeah. You really created a firestorm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo chuckled softly, the satisfaction of seeing the consequences of his actions beginning to sink in.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c13">Saburo</span><span class="c1">: Just like we planned.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c13">Ayane</span><span class="c1">: Yep.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c13">Ayane</span><span class="c1">: Good luck. I&rsquo;m rooting for you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo nodded to himself, feeling a strange sense of calm mixed with the adrenaline of it all. Before he could respond, he heard footsteps approaching. His eyes flicked up, and his heart skipped when he saw her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Emiko.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He had known this moment would come. She always took the bus at this time. It was routine. So was the conversation they were about to have, though neither of them knew it yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Saburo&hellip;&rdquo; Emiko&rsquo;s voice was soft, fragile, her eyes red, as though she had been crying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Emiko,&rdquo; Saburo replied, taking a sip of his coffee, something she had never seen him do before. He stared into the distance for a moment, the silence between them thick with the years of their shared history.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while,&rdquo; he added, his tone casual, but underneath, there was a coolness that hadn&rsquo;t been there before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Emiko reached out, pinching the sleeve of his shirt with a trembling hand. Her face contorted with regret. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she whispered, her voice breaking. &ldquo;I made a mistake&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo didn&rsquo;t let her finish. He met her eyes, and for the first time, he let the anger he&#39;d been holding in flood his voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Which one? Kissing Naoto when you thought I wasn&rsquo;t watching? Or going to bed with Naoto behind my back?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Emiko flinched, her face pale as she recoiled slightly from his words. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was a side to Saburo she had never seen before. He wasn&rsquo;t the quiet, shy boy she once knew. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His words were sharp, cutting through the layers of what had been left unsaid for so long. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And he didn&rsquo;t flinch when talking about such vulgar things anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Emiko&rsquo;s voice faltered as she trembled. &ldquo;I wanted to talk with you. I truly did. But&hellip; I got scared.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo frowned, his eyes narrowing. &ldquo;Even when I texted you and you never responded once?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Emiko hesitated, guilt flooding her face. &ldquo;Y-yes&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He looked away, letting the silence hang in the air. His heart ached for her, but there was nothing left to say. He couldn&rsquo;t fix this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you love him?&rdquo; he asked, his voice steady, though the question weighed heavily on him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">Emiko nodded hesitantly, her eyes avoiding </span><span class="c9">his</span><span class="c1">. &ldquo;&hellip;I do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo&rsquo;s lips tightened, and for a moment, he was at a loss for words. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He wanted to say so many things, warn her about Naoto, but something held him back. Perhaps it was better if she discovered it herself. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That would be his final revenge&mdash;letting her walk into the same trap that had ensnared him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead, he changed the subject, letting the silence settle between them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I suppose the whole school is talking about you now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Emiko frowned, her gaze lowering to the ground. &ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s calling me a cheater&hellip;&rdquo; Her voice quivered as her body shook with each word. &ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t deny it because it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo smiled, though it wasn&rsquo;t a smile of satisfaction. It was sad, almost bittersweet. He couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to enjoy her misery, but there was a small part of him that couldn&rsquo;t help but feel vindicated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now you know what it feels like to be betrayed by someone you trusted,&rdquo; he whispered, his voice low.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Emiko&rsquo;s head snapped up, her eyes wide with disbelief. &ldquo;W-what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo&rsquo;s voice dropped, cold and final.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Consider the rumors a parting gift from me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m breaking up with you, Emiko.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The words hung in the air, and for a moment, it felt like time itself had frozen. Emiko stood there, her body stiff and unmoving. Her eyes were wide, unable to process what he had just said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She slowly looked down, her face pale, as if searching for the right words, but they never came.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Saburo,&rdquo; she muttered finally, her voice barely a whisper. &ldquo;You always were a good friend. I never minded being around you. That&rsquo;s why I thought I could be happy if we were together. But&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her words choked off as tears began to fall, silently tracking down her cheeks. &quot;All I did was hurt you. I never thought about what you wanted, and&hellip; I ended up hurting myself too.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">She looked up at him, her gaze meeting </span><span class="c9">his</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;with an unexpected calmness. Through her tears, she smiled faintly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, Saburo. I can see now&hellip; I was never the one for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo&rsquo;s heart twisted, and he brushed a strand of her hair from her face, his smile sad and resigned. He still felt bad for her, but this was what he wanted. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Revenge, in some small way, was satisfying. But it was still bitter.</span></p><hr><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Later that day, Saburo entered the rooftop, his footsteps light as he approached Ayane. She was sitting there, watching the sunset, a can of coffee in her hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She turned toward him, tilting her head as her eyes met his.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So?&rdquo; she asked, her voice teasing but expectant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo smiled, though the expression didn&rsquo;t quite reach his eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I broke up with her,&rdquo; he said, his voice a mix of relief and resignation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;You actually did it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo raised an eyebrow, feigning offense. &ldquo;You doubted me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane chuckled, shaking her head as she pulled him into a hug. &ldquo;A little,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I guess I can&rsquo;t call you a coward anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a relief,&rdquo; Saburo muttered, his own voice soft with a quiet satisfaction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Ayane pulled back slightly, a thoughtful expression crossing her face. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get too relaxed,&rdquo; she teased, her voice playful. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to start being all cutesy now that you&rsquo;ve changed yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo smirked. &ldquo;What about after you break up with Naoto?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everything in the air froze. Ayane&rsquo;s smile disappeared, her posture tensing. She stepped back, turning her back to him, her shoulders stiff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Ayane?&rdquo; Saburo called out, his voice filled with concern. &ldquo;Did I say something wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane didn&rsquo;t answer immediately. When she did, her voice was quieter, more guarded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Breaking up with Naoto is not as easy as it sounds.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo studied her carefully, noticing the tension in her shoulders as she turned her back to him, her fingers curling into fists at her sides. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He took a step closer, reaching out slightly, but he hesitated before touching her. Instead, he spoke softly, trying to offer reassurance without pushing too hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I didn&#39;t mean to make it sound so simple,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But you&#39;re not the kind of person who would stay in a relationship that hurts you, are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane let out a long, almost frustrated sigh. She didn&#39;t turn to face him, but Saburo could hear the vulnerability in her voice when she finally spoke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">&ldquo;You don&#39;t get it, Saburo,&rdquo; she murmured, her words heavy with a weariness that cut through the air. &ldquo;It&#39;s not just about being hurt. It&#39;s about... </span><span class="c9 c11">everything</span><span class="c1">&mdash;the lies, the betrayal, the expectations. Naoto... he&#39;s not just some guy. He&#39;s the one everyone expects me to be with. The one everyone thinks I should be with.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo frowned, his brow furrowing in confusion. He stepped closer, his voice firm yet gentle as he spoke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not about what everyone expects. It&rsquo;s about what </span><span class="c9 c11">you</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;want. Don&rsquo;t you want to be free from all that pressure?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane didn&rsquo;t respond immediately. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The silence between them stretched on, and Saburo could feel the weight of her struggle, even without her words. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was caught in a web of expectations&mdash;something he couldn&#39;t entirely comprehend, but he understood enough to know it was holding her back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, Ayane turned to face him. Her eyes were filled with frustration, but also a deep sadness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course I want to be free,&rdquo; she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But what if breaking free means I lose everything? What if everything I&rsquo;ve known, everyone I&rsquo;ve known, turns their backs on me? I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m ready for that kind of change. Not yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo didn&rsquo;t know what to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He could sense the depth of Ayane&rsquo;s conflict, the fear that came with the idea of cutting ties with Naoto, even though he wasn&rsquo;t the right person for her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This wasn&rsquo;t about standing up to something that was clearly wrong&mdash;this was about confronting an overwhelming emotional burden that was rooted in years of expectations and entanglements.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nothing he thought of saying seemed right. She was faced with an incredibly difficult decision, one he couldn&rsquo;t easily help with. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t something he could solve with a simple answer. He couldn&rsquo;t just tell her to walk away and expect it to be easy. It was too complicated, too layered with emotion and history.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, he didn&rsquo;t want her to feel like she had to carry this alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;you promised me,&rdquo; Saburo said quietly, breaking the silence. He extended his hand toward her, his voice soft but steady. &ldquo;You said that if I broke up with Emiko... then you would break up with Naoto.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane&rsquo;s response was slow, almost reluctant, as if the words were hard to come by. After a long pause, she sighed deeply, her shoulders slumping as she turned her gaze downward. &ldquo;I say some crazy things, don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo smiled, his expression warm despite the seriousness of the moment. &ldquo;Yes. But I like hearing you talk.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane frowned, but there was no malice in the gesture. She approached him and, without a word, rested her head on his shoulder. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The simple gesture was a quiet confession, an admission of the vulnerability she had been hiding. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll break up with him,&rdquo; she whispered, her voice barely audible. &ldquo;One day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo smiled, his heart swelling with a quiet sense of hope. He wrapped his arm around her gently, his voice filled with quiet determination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I can wait,&rdquo; he said softly, knowing that no matter what happened next, he would be there for her, every step of the way.</span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.3pmxxbi7zn9"><span class="c13">Chapter 17 - Rainfall </span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next day, the school yet again buzzed with whispers of Saburo and Ayane. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rumors had already begun to spiral like wildfire, and the school&rsquo;s social atmosphere had shifted in ways Saburo hadn&rsquo;t fully anticipated. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the first time in a while, he was no longer just an anonymous student attached to Ayane. Now, he was the center of attention, the subject of everyone&rsquo;s conversation, and everyone knew his name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Ayane, too, found herself the subject of the school&#39;s gossip. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The curious glances and whispered comments always followed her wherever she went. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her relationship with Naoto had never been a secret, but now, everyone was wondering how long it would last&mdash;would she stay with him even after he cheated on her with Emiko?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">Ayane was no longer seen as a person who used others for her own means. She was now an unfortunate victim. She wasn&rsquo;t using people, she was </span><span class="c9 c11">being used</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">This was blatantly clear as soon as they entered the school doors. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Everyone stared at her with looks of pity and sympathy. Frankly, it was quite uncomfortable. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s pitying you,&rdquo; Saburo said with a chuckle.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Ayane rolled her eyes. &ldquo;After all that, now they&rsquo;re trying to act like they were on my side the whole time. Ridiculous.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">She made her way to her locker, but before she could even reach it, Naoto stormed over, his face twisted in fury. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">His presence seemed to make the air grow cold, like a storm cloud passing overhead. The students around them looked on from a distance, exchanging harsh whispers and judgmental stares.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c9 c11">&ldquo;Here he comes. Does he think he can act normal after everything?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c12 c9 c11">&ldquo;What an asshole!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Saburo chuckled. For once, he didn&rsquo;t hate the sound of gossip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naoto didn&rsquo;t acknowledge the murmurs or the stares. Instead, he fixed his glare on Ayane, his voice dripping with venom. &ldquo;Ayane! What&rsquo;s this I hear about you being with Saburo?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane met his gaze, the playful smirk never leaving her face. &ldquo;Oh, you heard? Yeah, we&rsquo;re together now. So what?&rdquo; she said casually, her tone almost too light, as though she wasn&rsquo;t the least bit fazed by his outrage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naoto&rsquo;s fury reached a boiling point. He stepped forward, grabbing her roughly by the shoulders, his grip tightening painfully. &ldquo;You&hellip; slut! After everything I&rsquo;ve done for you?&rdquo; His words were laced with rage and betrayal, as though he still felt entitled to her after everything he&rsquo;d done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane&rsquo;s eyes narrowed, her expression turning cold. &ldquo;Everything you&rsquo;ve done? Do you even realize how many times you&rsquo;ve made me feel like shit? And now you have the nerve to call me a slut?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naoto&rsquo;s face flushed with anger, and without warning, he made a move as if to lunge at her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo acted instinctively, stepping between them in a protective gesture, his gaze hardening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Knock it off,&rdquo; he snapped, his voice low and firm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, if it isn&rsquo;t the slut&rsquo;s new little fuck-buddy,&rdquo; Naoto sneered, a cruel smile forming on his lips.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo wasn&rsquo;t fazed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how Emiko ever fell for a shitty guy like you, and frankly, I don&rsquo;t care. But if you know what&rsquo;s good for you, you&rsquo;ll stay away from Ayane.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naoto&rsquo;s eyes narrowed into slits. &ldquo;Have you forgotten that I&rsquo;m her boyfriend?&rdquo; he spat, his tone dripping with arrogance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo shook his head, unphased. &ldquo;No, but I think you have. Maybe I should ask Emiko about that&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before Saburo could finish the sentence, Naoto&rsquo;s fist collided with his face, the blow knocking him backward onto the ground. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He felt the pain shoot through him, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough to stop him from glaring up at Naoto with defiance. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naoto wasn&rsquo;t done yet. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He followed up with a kick to Saburo&rsquo;s side, causing him to cough out blood, the air in his lungs stolen by the force of the blow. Naoto loomed over him, his sneer widening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re quiet now, huh? Not so tough against a real fight. Want to say anything else?&rdquo; Naoto taunted, his eyes glinting with smug satisfaction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo slowly pulled himself up, the world spinning around him, but there was no way he was going to let Naoto get away with it. He stumbled slightly, but his glare never wavered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. Go to hell,&rdquo; he growled, his voice rough with pain but no less determined.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In one swift motion, Saburo lashed out, landing a clean hit right between Naoto&rsquo;s legs. The sharp pain brought a strangled cry from Naoto, who collapsed to the floor, his face contorted in agony.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane&rsquo;s reaction was immediate&mdash;she couldn&rsquo;t hold back. Her laughter erupted, louder and more genuine than Saburo had ever heard. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was infectious, a sound of pure, unrestrained joy. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even the students around them couldn&rsquo;t help but stare in surprise at the sight of Ayane laughing so freely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane grinned, pulling Saburo&rsquo;s hand as she stormed down the hallway. &ldquo;You idiot,&rdquo; she muttered under her breath, though Saburo could see the hint of a smile tugging at the corner of her lips.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once they were in the safety of the infirmary, Ayane&rsquo;s hands moved swiftly, wrapping bandages around Saburo&rsquo;s wounds. He winced slightly at the pressure, but her movements were careful, deliberate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seriously, what the hell were you thinking?&rdquo; she asked, her voice calm, though there was a faint trace of amusement in it. &ldquo;You could&rsquo;ve gotten yourself seriously hurt.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking,&rdquo; Saburo mumbled, his voice hoarse. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane didn&rsquo;t respond right away. She just shook her head, her gaze softening as she finished bandaging his wound. After a long silence, she muttered, almost too quietly to hear, &ldquo;Thanks, by the way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; Saburo asked, his voice strained but curious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She met his eyes, her expression unreadable for a moment. &ldquo;I guess you weren&rsquo;t all talk, after all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo managed a crooked smile. &ldquo;I did say I would do it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane&rsquo;s laughter bubbled up again, this time softer but still infectious. &ldquo;Pfft&mdash;&rdquo; She covered her mouth, though the smile never left her face.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Saburo&rsquo;s body still ached, but hearing her genuine laughter made everything feel better.</span></p><hr><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Later that day, Saburo walked home from school, his phone buzzing in his hand. He checked the screen and saw a message from Ayane.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c13">Ayane</span><span class="c1">: I&rsquo;m thinking of breaking up with Naoto today. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat, and he texted back quickly.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c13">Saburo:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You got this. I believe in you.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">He stared at the screen for a moment, then put his phone in his pocket, taking a deep breath. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today was big for Ayane, and though he didn&rsquo;t want to doubt her, part of him was worried. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What if she hesitated?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or worse, what if Naoto tried something?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo hesitated, then turned around and ran toward her apartment, an uneasy feeling gnawing at him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Something didn&rsquo;t sit right.</span></p><hr><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, Ayane walked to her apartment, rain pricking her clothes. She looked up at the sky, taking a deep breath. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was cloudy; a storm was coming.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Could she do this? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Could she really break up with Naoto after everything?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wanted to. She truly did. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But every time she convinced herself it was the right thing, another part of her questioned if she was making a mistake. Was this the right move?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane shook her head. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, she had to be strong. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo believed in her. He encouraged her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They had promised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">He had broken up with Emiko, grown stronger for her sake. Now, she had to do the same&mdash;for </span><span class="c9">his</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ayane!&rdquo; Naoto&#39;s voice cut through the air as he approached.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rain grew stronger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Naoto,&rdquo; Ayane said, her voice calm, controlled. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn&rsquo;t going to yell. What good would that do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He shoved his phone in her face, displaying the text she had sent. &ldquo;What is this? Don&#39;t tell me you&rsquo;re actually going to&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m breaking up with you.&rdquo; The words tumbled out before she could second-guess herself. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had to be the one to say it, or she might never find the courage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bitch!&rdquo; Naoto slapped her across the face. &ldquo;What the hell&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rain intensified, but Ayane kept her composure. &ldquo;Nothing&#39;s wrong with me. I just... can&rsquo;t take it anymore. You&rsquo;re a piece of shit, Naoto.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You ungrateful little&mdash;&rdquo; He grabbed his head in frustration. &quot;Not only did you and your little pet ruin my reputation, but now you want to take away my status?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m not taking anything from you. You think I want to ruin your life? You think I want to be the subject of endless gossip?&rdquo; Ayane shook her head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do I care how you feel? All you had to do was stand there and take it!&rdquo; Naoto yelled. &ldquo;But I guess that wasn&rsquo;t enough for you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane facepalmed, exasperated. &ldquo;You really piss me off, Naoto.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a fit of rage, Naoto grabbed her by the shoulders, shaking her. &ldquo;Listen here, bitch! I am so sick of your attitude!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane laughed bitterly. &ldquo;Ha. What are you going to do, then? Kill me? That would ruin your life more than I ever could. Besides, you don&rsquo;t even have the guts.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naoto&#39;s eyes flared with fury. &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, his hands were around her neck, choking her as the rain poured down. Ayane gasped for air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The storm had come.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, out of nowhere, Saburo arrived, charging toward the scene. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His heart pounded in his chest as he saw Naoto&rsquo;s hands around Ayane&rsquo;s neck, his fury exploding in an instant. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Take your hands off her, asshole!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Without thinking, Saburo threw a punch, landing it square on Naoto&#39;s jaw.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naoto staggered back, his grip loosening on Ayane&rsquo;s neck just long enough for her to gasp for air. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But before Saburo could take another step, Naoto&rsquo;s rage flared, and he lunged forward, throwing a wild punch at Saburo&rsquo;s face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo wasn&rsquo;t a fighter&mdash;his punch had been instinct, not skill&mdash;but he managed to dodge the worst of Naoto&rsquo;s swing, the fist grazing his cheek.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo; Naoto spat, his voice dripping with venom. &ldquo;Stay the hell out of this, Saburo!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; Saburo wiped the blood from his lip, his vision blurred by adrenaline and pain. He wasn&rsquo;t thinking clearly&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t know how to fight, but he wasn&rsquo;t backing down. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You really think after everything, you can still control people like you used to?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naoto launched himself at Saburo, knocking him off balance and sending him crashing into a nearby streetlight. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo groaned as pain radiated through his body, but he forced himself to his feet, determination pushing him forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You think you can talk back to me now, huh?!&rdquo; Naoto yelled, trying to land another punch. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re weak! I&rsquo;m the only one who belongs with her! You have no idea how pathetic she was until she started dating me! I&rsquo;m her savior!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane grimaced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo gritted his teeth, sidestepping just in time to avoid a direct hit. His body was starting to ache, but he kept moving, his fists clenched and ready.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re no savior. You&rsquo;re nothing but a coward,&rdquo; Saburo shot back. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re so tough, then why are you always hurting people weaker than you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naoto snarled and swung again, but Saburo, fueled by sheer will, landed another wild punch, this time connecting with Naoto&rsquo;s stomach. Naoto grunted in pain, stumbling backward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You want to keep this up? I&rsquo;m not backing down anytime soon.&rdquo; Saburo&rsquo;s voice shook with frustration and anger. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His lip was bleeding, his head throbbing, but he wouldn&rsquo;t stop. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He couldn&rsquo;t. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naoto reeled, shaking his head to clear the dizziness. &ldquo;You think you&rsquo;ve won? You think you&#39;re some kind of hero now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo, his hands trembling from the effort, took a deep breath, his vision narrowing. He was exhausted, but his determination only grew stronger. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Who said anything about being a hero?&rdquo; He hissed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just being a decent human being!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naoto charged again, but this time Saburo dodged and, with the last of his strength, threw one final, weak punch. It landed squarely on Naoto&rsquo;s jaw.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The impact was enough to knock Naoto to the ground, his body slamming into the pavement with a sickening thud. His eyes fluttered closed, and he didn&#39;t move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo stood over him, panting, his lip swollen and bloodied. His body was shaking from the exertion, but the fight was over. He had won.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane, still struggling to catch her breath, watched the scene in disbelief. &ldquo;You... you actually did it,&rdquo; she said, her voice a mix of amazement and disbelief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo wiped the blood from his lip and stumbled toward her, his hands reaching out to steady himself as the adrenaline wore off. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; His voice was soft, concerned, his gaze lingering on her as though making sure she was really alright.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane smiled faintly, despite everything. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. But you&rsquo;re an idiot, Saburo.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He chuckled weakly, wiping his forehead. &ldquo;Yeah, I know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane&rsquo;s expression softened. &ldquo;Thank you... for everything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo gave a tired nod, his eyes sincere. &ldquo;Anytime.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The storm faded. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was over. </span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c15" id="h.e16tt6pvra5b"><span class="c13">Chapter 18 - What are we? </span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo and Ayane were free.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the first time, the whispers that filled the halls weren&rsquo;t sharp knives digging into Saburo&rsquo;s back. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They weren&rsquo;t cold stares branding Ayane with cruel names. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, the school had found a new topic of discussion&mdash;one that neither of them had to fear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c9 c11">&ldquo;Did you hear? Nakamura actually punched Naoto.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;More than once! I heard he had him pinned to the ground before someone pulled him off!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;And Naoto hasn&#39;t shown up since. What a coward.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Seriously. Guess he wasn&#39;t as cool as we thought he was.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, in hushed voices&mdash;almost with disbelief:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c12 c9 c11">&ldquo;Ayane looks... happy.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yeah. I never thought I&rsquo;d see the day.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;And Nakamura&mdash;he actually smiles now. It&rsquo;s kinda weird, but, like&hellip; good weird.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, there were still remnants of the old rumors. Whispers about Saburo being Ayane&rsquo;s plaything. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But they had lost their bite. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The story had changed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">People weren&rsquo;t laughing at him anymore. They were just watching. Curious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even Emiko, the girl who had once been his entire world, had grown quiet. In the face of his awful true nature, she barely spoke to Naoto now&mdash;not that he was around much anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo barely thought about them. He had no reason to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because now, he had Ayane.</span></p><hr><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rooftop was theirs again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo took a sip of coffee, feeling the warmth seep into his fingers. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He winced a little when his knuckles brushed against the can. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His hands were still wrapped in bandages, a reminder that he was no fighter&mdash;but it didn&rsquo;t matter. He had fought when it counted. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane sat beside him, her legs pulled up against her chest, her arms draped lazily over her knees. She was staring at the sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No cigarette between her fingers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No distant look in her eyes, as if she was searching for an escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just Ayane. Free.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How do your hands feel?&rdquo; she asked, her voice light, playful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo flexed his fingers, then shrugged. &ldquo;Like shit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane smirked. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about right. But hey, at least you can say you got a few good hits in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&#39;ll ever throw a punch again,&rdquo; Saburo admitted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Ayane said, nudging his arm. &ldquo;You already did it when it mattered.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Silence stretched between them, but it wasn&rsquo;t awkward. It wasn&rsquo;t full of things left unsaid, like before. It was comfortable. Warm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So&hellip; what do you think the future holds for us now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane tilted her head. &ldquo;The future?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. You&rsquo;ve never thought about the future before?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hm&hellip;&rdquo; Ayane hummed. &ldquo;I never really paid much attention to the future. It&rsquo;s only recently that I&rsquo;ve thought of actually having one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, why not start now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">Ayane shot him a side glance. &ldquo;What, have </span><span class="c9 c11">you</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;already started?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not really. But we&rsquo;re not going to be high school students forever.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She snorted. &ldquo;I don&#39;t think you realize how much of a procrastinator I really am.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m not saying you need to have a whole plan,&rdquo; Saburo said, leaning back. &ldquo;Just&hellip; think about it a little.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">&ldquo;You say </span><span class="c9">that like the</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;future&rsquo;s going to </span><span class="c9">be any different</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;from how things are now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo tilted his head. &ldquo;Well, who knows? Someone like Naoto might appear again. Maybe things will go dark for us.&rdquo; Then he grinned. &ldquo;Or maybe we&rsquo;ll even have loyal kouhai next year.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Pfft&mdash; who the hell would want to look up to us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, you never know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane hummed, nodding slightly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A quiet breeze swept over them, rustling Ayane&rsquo;s hair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a pause, she suddenly asked, &ldquo;Are you planning to go to college?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;College?&rdquo; Saburo blinked, then looked up at the sky. &ldquo;Maybe. Probably. What about you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Undecided,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll go traveling instead, take a scholarship or something.&rdquo; Then, with a grin, she turned to him. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;d probably be lonely if I left, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo hesitated, then exhaled. &ldquo;Yeah. After all, we&rsquo;re&hellip;&rdquo; He trailed off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane tilted her head. &ldquo;What? Lost your train of thought?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">&ldquo;No, I just realized&hellip; what </span><span class="c9 c11">are</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;we, anyway?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane raised an eyebrow, amused. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking me that again?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. You never gave me a real answer before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Neither did you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo let out a small chuckle. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That was because you didn&rsquo;t let me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">Ayane hummed, considering. &ldquo;Well&hellip; what do </span><span class="c9 c11">you</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;think we are?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He glanced at her. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re more than just&hellip; whatever we were before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane nodded, as if that made sense. Then, she smirked. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;re what some might call &lsquo;partners in crime&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Very romantic.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Am I wrong?&rdquo; Ayane stretched her arms, then turned to him fully. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo tilted his head with a smile, indulging her. &ldquo;Alright. What was our crime, then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane gave him a knowing look, as if the answer was obvious. &ldquo;Cheating death, of course.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo let out a breath of laughter, shaking his head, but he didn&rsquo;t argue. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn&rsquo;t wrong. They had both been hanging by a thread, teetering on the edge of something dangerous. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane on the rooftop, Saburo drowning in heartbreak. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And yet, here they were. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still breathing. Still here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead of responding, he took another sip of coffee, letting the warmth settle in his chest. That, combined with the cool breeze, was an incredibly soothing feeling. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo finally spoke, his voice quieter this time. &ldquo;We really made it out, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane glanced at him. &ldquo;What, you doubted us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course I did,&rdquo; he said bluntly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d ever reach a point where you&rsquo;d stop looking at the edge of the roof.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She smiled, a small, knowing thing. &ldquo;Yeah&hellip; me neither.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He turned toward her, studying her. She was calm now. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her calm made him calm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; he said before he could think better of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane blinked, momentarily caught off guard. Then her grin widened. &ldquo;Oh? That&rsquo;s pretty sweet of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Forget it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Too late. You already said it,&rdquo; she teased. &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll just have to return the favor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;And what favor would that be?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane tilted her head, considering. Then, before he could react, she reached over and ruffled his hair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The smirk softened. Her eyes were bright, warm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Saburo.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane&rsquo;s toothy smile was brighter than the sun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo blinked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a long, breathless second, he just stared at her, as if he hadn&rsquo;t heard right. But there was no mistaking the words. No mistaking the way she said them&mdash;without hesitation, without doubt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And then, Saburo smiled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You always amaze me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not an answer, you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo exhaled, a quiet chuckle leaving his lips. &ldquo;Yeah, yeah. I know.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, with a gentle hand, he leaned in and gave her a peck on the lips. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ayane blinked. For once, she was the one caught off guard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fingers, still half-buried in his hair, twitched slightly before she pulled her hand away, tucking it into her lap like she didn&rsquo;t know what to do with it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A slow grin spread across her lips, and she let out a soft, breathy laugh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo; she breathed, her cheeks pink. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The warmth of their laughter lingered between them, soft and unguarded. Saburo felt the heat creeping up his own face, but he didn&rsquo;t look away. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He didn&rsquo;t want to.</span></p><hr><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a while afterwards, they just sat there. The breeze was just right, the sky was open, and the rooftop&mdash;their rooftop&mdash;was quiet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t heavy. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t something to run from. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was something to rest in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saburo let out a slow breath and turned to Ayane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn&rsquo;t on the edge, looking towards the ground below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was looking right at him.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
