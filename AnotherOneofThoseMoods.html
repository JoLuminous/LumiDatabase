She was preparing to make a new colorful social media post for her Insta, when all of a sudden&hellip; she just froze. No panic, no emotional outbursts. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She just stopped, placed her phone down on her desk, and frowned. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Why is it&hellip; that I feel this way towards Hitori-chan? Why do I feel this ugly jealousy?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that, Kita did the only thing she could think of. She ran away. </span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At Starry, Nijika was pacing in frustration, clutching her phone angrily. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are we doing this again?&rdquo; she cried, breaking the tense silence. &ldquo;Bocchi-chan disappears and now Kita does the same thing?&rdquo; Her voice carried both frustration and worry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t bother her,&rdquo; Ryo said, just as disinterested as ever. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s probably dealing with something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ryo!&rdquo; Nijika exclaimed, storming over to her with an unavoidable glare. &ldquo;Why do you never take these things seriously?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because they are never serious,&rdquo; Ryo said with a shrug. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Hitori sat quietly nearby, watching them bicker with a deepening frown. She glanced down at her phone, rereading the last message Kita had sent: </span><span class="c5">&ldquo;I need to rest today. Sorry.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Something about the wording felt off, it was too terse, too curt, like it had been written in haste without much care in what was being expressed. None of the cheerfulness Kita usually radiated could be felt from these words. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if Hitori&rsquo;s own running away experience was anything to go off of, this was exactly what she feared. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitori snuck out before Njikia and Ryo could notice, heading to the one place she suspected Kita would be. She hopped on the train and went towards the ocean. </span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kita knew this was foolish. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just a few days ago, she had been the one freaking out over Hitori&rsquo;s disappearance, but now here she was doing the exact same thing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But truth be told, she couldn&rsquo;t blame Hitori for running away back then. Life has a way of pushing people past their reasonable limits, no matter how well they thought they had it together. Even someone &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; like Kita wasn&rsquo;t immune to being overwhelmed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>That thought stuck with her. </span><span class="c4">How did Hitori-chan do it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kita felt drained over trivial thoughts like these, but Hitori was drained almost all the time. It was difficult to imagine how she got through the day on overdrive. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that was almost better for her, wasn&rsquo;t it? Hitori never had to hide how she felt. Her vulnerability, her struggles, even her comedic moments of panic were out in the open for everyone to see, and no one seemed to judge her for it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But no one knew how the real Ikuyo Kita felt. To be fair, that was her own fault for hiding everything, for keeping her inner weakness locked within. There were parts of herself that even her bandmates didn&rsquo;t know. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Heck, she didn&rsquo;t even want people to know her given name &ldquo;Ikuyo.&rdquo; That name belonged to someone else, someone she had long tucked away. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was why Kita couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to call Hitori by the nickname her fellow bandmates came up with. Sure, the name &ldquo;Bocchi&rdquo; seemed endearing, like a way to be closer with her, but it also felt too close to being a cover. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">I don&rsquo;t want that for Hitori-chan</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;Kita thought. </span><span class="c5">And I don&rsquo;t want that for myself either.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it was too late to express reservations. She had already cemented herself as a girl with an image. She had to be perfect, the girl other girls wanted to be. Sure, that made her happy at first, but was it really what she wanted? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At least with Kessoku Band, Kita was part of something that took real effort on her part&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She sighed, looking out at the open ocean around her. It was peaceful, quiet, save for the occasional passing car. It was no wonder why Hitori came to this place once before. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>But for Kita, even this peace felt tainted by conflict. As much as she wanted to soak in the stillness and take a deep breath, a nagging thought kept surfacing, a thought she absolutely hated: </span><span class="c4">This&rsquo;ll get so many likes on Insta if I post it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>It was awful. The idea of turning this private respite into something performative felt wrong, disgusting beyond belief.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&rsquo;d already crossed that line once before, hadn&rsquo;t she? Signing the band up for the festival, pushing Hitori into a spotlight she hadn&rsquo;t asked for&mdash;it was all supposed to be for the band&rsquo;s benefit. At least, that&rsquo;s what she told herself. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the truth? Kita wasn&rsquo;t so sure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was still surprised at how well it went, especially after what happened with Hitori&rsquo;s guitar string. But that girl&hellip; that cool pink-haired freak somehow pulled it off. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment, all Kita could think of was how guilty she felt. She was the one who went against Hitori&rsquo;s decision, she was the one who put all the pieces together that led to that unexpected event. Yes, she&rsquo;d improvised on stage, giving Hitori the time to pull it all together at the end, but even that felt dubious. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Was she truly helping her bandmate, or was it just another way to bask in the audience&rsquo;s admiration? Had she signed them up for the festival out of a genuine desire to support the band, or because she wanted to look good for her school fans?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kita was always full of these doubts, though she never, ever, expressed them. If she suddenly showed her faults&mdash;if people saw the real Ikuyo Kita&mdash;what would everyone think?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If there was one thing Kita Ikuyo was scared of the most, it was being judged for her true self. </span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitori nearly jumped from the train and ran down the street. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then she saw Kita standing there, looking out at the ocean with her arms on a familiar metal railing. She approached. &ldquo;Kita-chan&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kita turned around in surprise and then looked to the ground. &ldquo;Hitori-chan&hellip; what are you doing here?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was worried&hellip;&rdquo; Hitori muttered. &ldquo;I thought&hellip; something happened to you.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kita turned her back on her. &ldquo;Thank you for being worried. But I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she mumbled. &ldquo;I want to be alone, Hitori-chan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alone&hellip;?&rdquo; Hitori tilted her head. &ldquo;Did something happen? Usually, you&hellip; aren&rsquo;t like this.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I said I want to be alone,&rdquo; Kita cried, before recoiling in regret. &ldquo;Sorry, I&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t mean to yell. How&rsquo;d you even find me anyway?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitori frowned. &ldquo;I found this place&hellip; when I ran away before&hellip; I thought you might have found it too.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kita sighed. &ldquo;Hitori-chan&hellip; I&hellip; I feel awful. I see you, and all I can think is how jealous I am&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to feel this way&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to hate you.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitori froze. &ldquo;...Jealous?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Of me?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kita made a resigned smile. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so cool, Hitori-chan&hellip; sure, I have lots of friends, but what good is that if everyone expects so much of me? This extroverted side of me is just an image to protect myself&hellip; but you&rsquo;ve got a lot doing what you love. If you left Kessoku Band, you could still succeed with your Youtube, but I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t really have anything of worth without this band.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t realize you were so insecure, Kita-chan&hellip;&rdquo; Hitori said in surprise. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I guess I do a good job of hiding it&hellip;&rdquo; Kita muttered with a resigned look. Hitori frowned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kita-chan, you aren&rsquo;t nothing. I wouldn&rsquo;t be confident enough to chase after you if you didn&rsquo;t give me encouragement everyday. Sometimes I dislike the extroverted things you make me do, but because of those things, I&hellip; I have become more accustomed to them. You&rsquo;re important to me, Kita-Chan,&rdquo; said Hitori, and then she blushed. &ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m not good at&hellip; encouragement.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kita said nothing for a few seconds and then hugged her softly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you, Hitori-chan,&rdquo; she said with a grateful smile. &ldquo;I guess&hellip; I really needed to hear that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But as Kita stared gratefully at Hitori, she came to a realization that maybe jealousy wasn&rsquo;t what she was feeling. Maybe she was feeling obsessive&hellip; perhaps she didn&rsquo;t want Hitori to drift away from her, being her closest friend that wasn&rsquo;t near her for the sake of her popularity. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Kita would never admit that, no matter how much sense it made. She could get embarrassed too, after all. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A tinge of pink appeared on Kita&rsquo;s cheeks. &ldquo;Um, Hitori-chan&hellip;&rdquo; she began. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Hitori turned towards her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Actually, the truth is, I&mdash;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Hitori would never get the chance to hear what Kita had to say, as Nijika appeared at that very moment. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kita-chan, there you are!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;So this is the faraway place you guys keep disappearing to. I should remember this&hellip; um, what are you doing?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Kita and Hitori looked at each other and realized they were still hugging. They quickly parted, their faces pink. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hm&hellip;&rdquo; Nijika glanced between them. &ldquo;Did I interrupt something?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Looked like they were about to kiss or something,&rdquo; Ryo said casually as she walked up, which caused Kita and Hitori to cough violently.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;T-that&rsquo;s not&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, can we go back now?&rdquo; Ryo asked, glancing towards the train station. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not wanting to be killed by our manager anytime soon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s head back. I don&rsquo;t want onee-chan to worry either,&rdquo; Nijika said with a nod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Nijika and Ryo walked ahead, Kita glanced at Hitori, her blush lingering.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you again, Hitori-chan,&rdquo; she murmured softly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hitori gave her a shy smile. &ldquo;Y-yeah, anytime.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Kita smiled shyly in return. Her hand slowly drifted towards one of Hitori&rsquo;s own, though as soon as her fingers brushed against Hitori&rsquo;s skin, she pulled back, her blush growing darker. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Hitori noticed this and blushed herself. Smoke sizzled from her head, her mind short-circuiting from the affectionate gesture. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Njika, catching a glimpse of the two guitarists melting in their embarrassment, shook her head with a resigned sigh. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What am I going to do with those two?&rdquo;</span></p></body></html>
