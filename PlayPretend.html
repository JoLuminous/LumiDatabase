Her legs wouldn&rsquo;t budge. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her head felt like it was going to split open, as if someone was banging a gong continuously in her mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why was life so hard? Why did she have to suffer this fate day after day in order to survive?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, after what felt like an eternity, she swung her legs over the side of the bed and forced herself to stand. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Stumbling a little, Kikuri attempted to make her way to the bathroom. All around her, empty sake boxes and old pieces of trash were scattered about, as if someone had thrown them carelessly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&hellip;clean this eventually&hellip;&rdquo; she muttered, reaching the bathroom sink. She splashed cold water on herself in an attempt to wash away her drowsiness. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri stopped and looked in the mirror. There were deep bags under her eyes and her hair was a mess. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To be fair, her entire being was messy. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri chuckled sourly. &ldquo;What a terrible face&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her phone buzzed on the sink counter, the screen lighting up with a message from one of her Sick Hack band members, Shima Iwashita.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Sighing, she picked it up and read the terse text: </span><span class="c5 c7">&ldquo;Kikuri, you missed practice yesterday. Get your act together!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, yeah&hellip;whatever you say,&rdquo; Kikuri mumbled, though no one was there to hear her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She tied up her hair and threw on a jacket, making herself look somewhat normal. Then she forced a smile, though in reality she wanted to frown. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shima was right, of course. She was a hot mess and needed to get things in order, but how could she? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t easy for Kikuri to reach this point, where people had some sense of interest in her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she did improve herself, well&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri shook her head, walking along the bustling roads. It wasn&rsquo;t worth thinking about such topics, not when the outcome was already obvious. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stopped into a convenience store and purchased a small box of sake, taking a sip with an expression that was both despondent and contained a fake smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why was she pretending to smile? Even Kikuri didn&rsquo;t have a concrete answer, but perhaps it was the only way she could justify alcohol to herself. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">She was smiling, so didn&rsquo;t that mean it was fine?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not really, but she still needed the flawed justification anyway. She just had to pretend it was perfectly flawless, and it was. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For her, at least.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The familiar neon sign of Starry greeted Kikuri as she descended the club steps. As she pushed the door open, the sound of instruments reached her ears, drifting out in a cacophony of melodies and song. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri felt a pang of longing and sadness. She missed the days when music was just a fun pastime, an activity that brought her joy despite her loneliness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These days, music seemed to be another factor that added to her anxiety and stress. She still loved it, but something had changed&hellip;or maybe she was the one who changed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here again?&rdquo; Seika&rsquo;s voice cut through her thoughts, sharp as ever. The older Ijichi sister sat at the bar, arms crossed in disapproval.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri frowned. Seika was one of her longtime friends, and she was always strict, always critical of her reckless actions to the highest degree. At the same time, she was also one of the few people who cared about the bassist, even if she had trouble showing it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Where else would I be?&rdquo; Kikuri muttered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seika noticed there was something off about her and stared intently. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s with that tone?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Kikuri said nervously with a fake smile. &ldquo;I had just had a rough night.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seika rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Every night is a rough night for you,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;You seriously need to get your act together, Kikuri. You&rsquo;re a hot mess.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri forced a laugh, the sound hollow even to her. &ldquo;Yeah, yeah, I know. I&rsquo;m working on it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seika sighed, shaking her head with a hint of worry. &ldquo;Whatever. Just&hellip;don&rsquo;t cause any trouble, alright?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri nodded, making her way to the bar. She found a seat at the corner to sit in, watching as Seika&rsquo;s younger sister, Nijika, led her band, Zip Tie, through a routine practice session. Nijika was passionate about the success of her band, leading them with apt confidence that made Kikuri feel inadequate. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was true that she was practically the poster girl for Sick Hack, but she didn&rsquo;t really lead them all that well, did she? They just sort of attracted success because of her drunken antics. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri sighed and found herself looking towards Hitori Gotoh, Zip Tie&rsquo;s second guitarist. The shy, introverted girl had come quite a long way since joining the band, but traces of her insecurity still remained, in ways that mirrored the bassist&rsquo;s own. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori looked up to her, Kikuri knew as much, and though they rarely spoke, there was a silent sense of camaraderie between them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">It was a miracle, really, that </span><span class="c5 c10">anyone</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;looked up to her, of all people. What made her even worth looking up to?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was a miserable, lonely, introverted, insecure, mess of a person. She made music, but only to mask her many faults and anxieties. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then again, so was Hitori Gotoh.</span></p><hr><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">During a break in practice, Hitori hesitated for a moment before approaching Kikuri. &ldquo;Um, Hiroi-san&hellip;are you okay?&rdquo; she asked nervously. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri forced another smile, though it felt even more fragile than before. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, Bocchi-chan. Just a little tired, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori&rsquo;s brow furrowed slightly, but she decided not to press the issue any further. &ldquo;Um&hellip;if you ever need to talk&hellip;I&rsquo;m here&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Kikuri replied, touched by her concern. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m okay. I really am.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori didn&rsquo;t seem to believe her words, but she walked away, not wanting to upset her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri frowned. Did Hitori see something? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She shook her head. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, that wasn&rsquo;t possible. Hitori was just concerned, that&rsquo;s all. What was there to worry about?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri took another sip of her sake box, finding it to be empty. When did she drink the rest? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Was it unconsciously? Had she grown so accustomed to the feeling that she didn&rsquo;t even notice? Kikuri laid her head down on the bar, groaning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was awful. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She knew it was awful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She knew she was a disgusting person for allowing this to happen to her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it was now a part of her. Something she couldn&rsquo;t get rid of, even if she tried. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And she certainly tried.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri held a hand over her right wrist, wincing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was a time she would keep to the back of her mind for as long as she lived. No one needed to know. No one did know. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had to keep it that way. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri&rsquo;s grip on her wrist tightened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Did she have to keep it that way?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What if she was wrong? What if there was a way of getting past all this? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No, no, she couldn&rsquo;t do that. Not when the resulting outcome would be so dreadful and annoying. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The pitiful stares, the constant worries and concerns, she didn&rsquo;t want any of that. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was better to be judged as a drunk, than be pitied as a depressed loser. It was, right? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Or maybe it wasn&rsquo;t. Maybe she was an idiot, and just wanted to keep her alcohol. Maybe she just didn&rsquo;t want to lose the tool that made her feel some small semblance of worth to people, even if it was hurting her in the process.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri chuckled coldly. What normal person would try to justify alcohol to themselves? No, she was far beyond being a &lsquo;normal&rsquo; person. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was an idiot, through and through. But not without reason. Not without consequence. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...what an idiot.&rdquo; she muttered to herself. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seika overheard her and nodded. &ldquo;Yes, you are.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri looked up from her depressed stupor and pretended to be embarrassed. &ldquo;Have you been watching me this whole time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course. Who knows what you&rsquo;ll do if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Seika snapped, though there was a hint of care in her words. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No one trusts me! Except for Bocchi-chan.&rdquo; Kikuri mumbled with a sigh. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seika rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Probably because she&rsquo;s too nervous to say otherwise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri pouted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s mean! Now I&rsquo;m upset. Buy me a drink, senpai!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not happening.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aww! Please?&rdquo; Kikuri wined, her actions a mix of her true feelings and the act she was putting on. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri frowned and laid her head back down on the bar. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nijika, who had been watching their conversation, eyed Kikuri with mild disdain. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why do you always come here drunk?&rdquo; she asked, frustration clear in her voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have your own band to worry about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri shrugged, trying to repel their concerns with humor. &ldquo;What can I say? Starry has the best company.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seika shook her head. &ldquo;You can laugh everything off as a joke now, but when something serious happens, it&rsquo;ll be too late. You need to take better care of yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri brushed it off, as she always did, but the comments stung and bit at her more than she would like to admit. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c5">Please don&rsquo;t worry about me. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was irked by the concerned glances, the words of worry and advice. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c10">But also, don&rsquo;t see this as all I am. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wished people would see past her faults, the drunken antics, everything. That was why Sick Hack was a respite from all of this. She could do whatever she wanted there without anyone judging her for it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the more she stayed there and basked in the freedom, the worse effect it had on her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She became more reckless, more rock and roll, more&hellip;dangerous. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And the pain didn&rsquo;t just go away. It multiplied further and further, until&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri clenched her wrist. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She didn&rsquo;t want to think about it. Not now.</span></p><hr><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After practice ended, Kikuri lingered for a while longer, watching Zip Tie pack up their equipment. She could feel someone&rsquo;s eyes on her and looked up, seeing Hitori staring intently. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young guitarist took a deep breath and approached her nervously. &ldquo;Hiroi-san&hellip;there&rsquo;s something I wanted to ask you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri smiled, genuinely this time, and gestured to the empty seat next to her. &ldquo;Sure, Bocchi-chan. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori fidgeted with her hands, debating whether she should speak. &ldquo;I&hellip;I just wanted to know&hellip;are you sure you&rsquo;re okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri&rsquo;s face went blank and she turned away from her with a frown. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, Bocchi-chan. Just dealing with&hellip;some stuff.&rdquo; she said, her voice quiet and emotionless. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori hesitated, then leaned in slightly, whispering so no one could hear: &ldquo;I noticed&hellip;the scars on your arm. You really tried to&hellip;hurt yourself&hellip;?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri&rsquo;s breath caught in her throat, her heart pounding. She had been so careful, so particular with her movements in order to hide those scars. She never wanted anyone to see them, anyone to know what was behind them, anyone to judge her for creating them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet Hitori noticed, and that left her feeling vulnerable, weak, exposed, like all the walls she built for herself had been demolished. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You saw&hellip;that?&rdquo; Kikuri whispered, her voice shaking. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&hellip;I&rsquo;m not going to tell anyone, I just&hellip;I wanted you to know that someone is here for you. I know I&rsquo;m not the best at talking, but&hellip;I care about you, Hiroi-san.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sincerity in Hitori&rsquo;s words hit Kikuri hard like a tidal wave. Tears welled up in her eyes, but she wiped them away so no one would see. Her body was shaking violently, and everything she kept within herself was just begging to break free. But she couldn&rsquo;t let it. Not now. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the same time&hellip;someone like Hitori&hellip;would it hurt to rely on her? To trust her? To confide in her the deep secrets held inside her heart?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bocchi-chan, thank you,&rdquo; Kikuri started, turning around with a sad smile. &ldquo;But&hellip;sorry!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri took a swig of alcohol and ran out of Club Starry in a rush, not stopping despite the words of those around her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seika watched the whole ordeal, unsure of what to make of it. What had happened to cause her to run like that? Was it something Hitori had said?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">She looks over at Hitori, who had an unusual sad frown on her face. The girl was known for always being gloomy, but this expression was sadder than any Seika had ever seen. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What did they talk about?</span></p><hr><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kikuri ran into her apartment and closed the door tightly. She surveyed the mess around her and sighed. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The empty sake boxes, the discarded food containers, and in a corner she tried to forget, a sharp tool she had once used to hurt herself. The memory made her stomach churn, her body shake, and she grabbed her wrist, feeling pain, even though the wound was long healed. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Lying down on her bed, Kikuri stared up at the ceiling, forcing herself to smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But deep down she knew it was a lie. She was just deluding herself. Of course Seika and Nijika were right to be concerned about her. Of course Hitori was right about her. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Why was she so afraid to admit that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Why couldn&rsquo;t she stop pretending? She wasn&rsquo;t fine. She wasn&rsquo;t okay. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She was destroying herself. And she was scared of herself. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Playing pretend, phoning it in as a &lsquo;skilled drunken bassist&rsquo; was fun for a while, but it couldn&rsquo;t go on. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She didn&rsquo;t want to be a drunken bassist. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She just wanted to be a bassist. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kikuri reached for her phone and took a deep breath. She dialed a number and waited for an answer. Eventually, she heard the voice she wanted to hear. &ldquo;...Hello? Hiroi-san?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kikuri smiled sadly and shakily held the phone up to her ear. Her smile was dropping, but that didn&rsquo;t matter. This was a step she needed to take. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hello, Bocchi-chan. Let&rsquo;s have a talk.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c9" id="h.knlpznidony9"><span class="c6">Play Pretend 2</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s my story,&rdquo; Kikuri Hiroi said with a resigned smile. &ldquo;Depressing, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori shook her head. &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;Insecurity is&hellip;painful.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri chuckled sadly. &ldquo;See, this is why I feel so comfortable talking the truth with you, Bocchi-chan. You get me.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori sat quietly, her eyes full of empathy and understanding. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The morning sky was gray and the streets around them were eerily quiet. They sat on a pair of secluded street steps, and an overwhelming sense of heaviness lingered in the air, furthered by the unspoken emotions that bubbled beneath the bassist&rsquo;s surface. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This was a side of her that Hitori never expected to see. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri frowned, her hands trembling as she took a sip from a water bottle. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You know, it&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; she said, her voice almost a whisper. &ldquo;I always thought I would get better as I grew older, but as the years have gone by, I&rsquo;ve found myself becoming worse. I still feel insecure and conscious of how others feel about me. No matter how much I try to hide it, I can&rsquo;t help the fear that envelops me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori nodded slowly, finding similarities in her words. &ldquo;I&hellip;I always get scared too,&rdquo; she admitted, her voice wavering. &ldquo;Talking to people scares me&hellip;I don&rsquo;t want to be judged&hellip;or hated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri stared at the ground, a distant look in her eyes. &ldquo;You want to escape it all,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;But it always haunts you. Alcohol can make things seem better, it can make you feel invincible from those truths, but in the end, it&rsquo;s all a lie. A dangerous, destructive lie.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The air fell silent again, the weight of Kikuri&rsquo;s truth hanging in the air like an inescapable shadow. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori could see the pain in her eyes, and it made her feel so sympathetic. She certainly wasn&rsquo;t one to dole out overwhelming concern, but something about Kikuri just made her&hellip;sad. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There was a time,&rdquo; Kikuri started, her voice barely audible, &ldquo;when I tried to get away from all this. I thought I could do it. I thought I could just&hellip;toss the awful habits and thoughts aside. I didn&rsquo;t want to rely on the bitter drink, the false side of myself, the&hellip;unrealistic expectations my drunken side had set. But the anxiety, the fear&hellip;it was all too much. I felt like I was drowning under my own failures, insecurities, everything. And in that moment of darkness, when my hope was at its lowest, I&hellip;&rdquo; She clutched her wrist, her fingers shakily tracing the faint scars that told Hitori everything she needed to know. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hitori frowned, her heart aching. &ldquo;...so&hellip;those scars&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kikuri nodded, her entire form shaking. &ldquo;Yes. I was in a bad place. And I hate myself for letting things get that far. For allowing my fears to control me. I feel like an awful, terrible person.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hitori reached out, testing her own limits. She wasn&rsquo;t used to doing these kinds of things at all, but it just&hellip;felt right, in the moment. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Everyone feels weak, Kikuri-san,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;And sometimes, we&hellip;do things we aren&rsquo;t proud of&hellip;but that doesn&rsquo;t make you a bad person&hellip;so, don&rsquo;t feel sad. What matters, is you&rsquo;re here&hellip;or something like that. I guess I&rsquo;m not good at being encouraging&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Tears welled up in Kikuri&rsquo;s eyes, but she chuckled through them. &ldquo;Haha. Thank you, Bocchi-chan,&rdquo; she laughed, her voice soft. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to worry. Your words mean more to me than you&rsquo;ll ever know&hellip;they are what has led me to reveal all these things about myself&hellip;I&rsquo;m even reconsidering my decision to drink.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hitori gave a small smile. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good musician, Kikuri-san&hellip;I think&hellip;you deserve to be happy.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kikuri wiped her eyes and took Hitori in a big hug, surprising her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Bocchi-chan. And so is Senpai. Despite her toughness, she&rsquo;s been right about so many things&hellip;I want to try to face my fears, without the alcohol,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be easy, but I have to believe that I can do it. I know I can&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hitori nodded. &ldquo;...you can. I&rsquo;ve been doing it,&rdquo; she encouraged. &ldquo;But I also&hellip;have a long way to go.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kikuri smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re stronger than you give yourself credit for, Bocchi-chan. In the many years I&rsquo;ve been struggling with my problems, you&rsquo;re the only one who directly approached me with concern. Broaching a subject like this takes serious guts, so&hellip;&rdquo; She placed a hand on Hitori&rsquo;s head and rubbed her hair fondly. &ldquo;Thanks for being brave, for my sake. I really appreciate it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hitori blushed and giggled shamelessly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip;it&rsquo;s nothing, Kikuri-san&hellip;hehe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For a moment, they sat there in silence, the bond between them stronger as a result of their shared feelings. It was a moment of vulnerability, honesty, and of hope for a future in which they could face things head on without the insecurity and anxiety that plagued them. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A new chapter was beginning for both of them, and as long as they kept working towards the hopeful future they wanted so badly, they would one day succeed, together.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As the hour wore on, they talked more about their fears, their emotions, and their dreams. Kikuri told stories of her past, of the moments when she felt most alone. She shared times when everyone ignored her, when her efforts to find music oriented friends ended in solidarity, when the weight of the world felt at its highest. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The first time I drank alcohol, I was actually underage,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;There was a party, and I wanted to fit in with everyone else.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Manager-san didn&rsquo;t&hellip;try to stop you?&rdquo; Hitori asked curiously. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, she encouraged me,&rdquo; Kikuri said with a chuckle. &ldquo;She told me that it would make me feel better. Those days, I was always depressed and lonely, even with Senpai at my side. Like always, she was just worried about me, and thought drinking would give me a boost. And well, it did succeed at that, I suppose&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hitori stared at Kikuri thoughtfully. &ldquo;Are you and Manager-san on good terms?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kikuri nodded with a smile. &ldquo;Of course we are,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I know she can be quite&hellip;rough, at times, and she has a harsh way of speaking, but she&rsquo;s actually pretty sentimental. A lot of things she says are because she&rsquo;s worried about people. She only yells at me because of my own faults. And she would never admit it, but she&rsquo;s tough on you guys because she really cares about your band. She doesn&rsquo;t want you to fail. But the problem is that she tries too hard to seem indifferent, so&hellip;she&rsquo;s often misunderstood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hitori frowned. &ldquo;Well, I&hellip;I think she should try more&hellip;to help you&hellip;instead of yelling.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; Kikuri chuckled. &ldquo;But try saying that to her face. It probably won&rsquo;t go over well. You see, she&rsquo;s sentimental, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean she can&rsquo;t get pissy.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Pfft&ndash;&rdquo; Hitori covered her mouth to hide a giggle. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They both shared in each other&rsquo;s feelings. Kikuri&rsquo;s laughter, though still tinged with a bit of sadness, became more frequent as time went on. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hitori shared her own stories of her struggles, the crippling anxiety that often left her falling apart, and the small moments of joy with her friends that kept her going and made her feel more confident. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She found solace in Kikuri&rsquo;s presence, and Kikuri, in turn, found solace in hers. There was something about the fact that they shared the pain, the feelings of ineptitude and overwhelming fear. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kikuri threw an arm around Hitori and smiled. &ldquo;So, Kouhai, I see you brought your guitar like I asked.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; Hitori nodded, glancing at the guitar case that lay next to her. &ldquo;Why&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kikuri picked up her bass and tossed it on her shoulder. &ldquo;Well, what better way to deal with these heavy feelings than playing a bit of music, am I right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hitori unzipped her case and pulled out her guitar. &ldquo;What are we doing?&rdquo; she asked curiously. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How about some street performing? Like last time?&rdquo; Kikuri suggested with a grin. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hitori frowned. &ldquo;I&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for this&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kikuri tapped her on the shoulder. &ldquo;Come now, Kouhai. You&rsquo;ve done plenty since then. I believe in you.&rdquo; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A-alright&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They walked together to a quiet spot on a nearby curb. It was a pretty active area, but not in the midst of the bustle of the city. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;When we did this before, you told me it helped a great deal. Maybe it can help me now,&rdquo; Kikuri said, staring down at her bass. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They set up their instruments and began to play, their music filling the air. At first, only a few passersby stopped to listen, but over time a small crowd began to gather. Kikuri felt the familiar thrill of performing wash over her, yet the lack of alcohol and the presence of Hitori led to new feelings that she hadn&rsquo;t experienced in what felt like years. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She wasn&rsquo;t drunk, so why did this feel so exciting? So exhilarating? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kikuri had forgotten this feeling, and now that she was experiencing it again, she felt emotional. How could she have lost sight of what made music so great? She didn&rsquo;t need alcohol to feel this way, but she had become reliant on it. She had been ensnared, but now&hellip;the trap had finally been cut free. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Of course, it would take more than just a street performance and a few conversations to lead her to a proper recovery, but this was a good start. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kikuri strummed her bass, the chords mingling with Hitori&rsquo;s own to create a melody of emotion, soul, and, naturally, rock and roll.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They honestly felt like staying in that spot all day, taking in the gratifying feelings that surrounded them for a little while longer, but the end had to arrive eventually. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As the crowd finally dispersed, Kikuri turned to Hitori, her eyes sparkling with genuine happiness and thankfulness. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thank you, Bocchi-chan. It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve felt happy doing this. I haven&rsquo;t felt this good in a long time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hitori shook her head profusely. &ldquo;N-no&hellip;it wasn&rsquo;t just me&hellip;this wouldn&rsquo;t have happened if&hellip;you didn&rsquo;t call me first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kikuri chuckled. Impulsively, she leaned in and kissed Hitori on the cheek. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to work on myself. For your sake, Bocchi-chan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hitori took her hand shyly, a flushed expression on her face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kikuri smiled. &ldquo;I know you will,&rdquo; she said, hugging Hitori softly. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c9" id="h.hwsv565176e4"><span class="c6">Play Pretend 3 (finale)</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I hope she likes this,&rdquo; Hitori Gotoh muttered as she walked down the dimly lit streets. Ahead, the bright neon lights of a nightclub were in view. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her thoughts were on a notebook that lay within her bag, nestled amongst other belongings. This one object, simple as it was, had been plaguing her for the entire day. She had spent the previous few nights depriving herself of sleep in order to write two songs on its pages. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One was for Zip Tie, part of her usual work routine these days as she had chosen not to immediately attend college. The other song, however, was different&ndash;more personal, more heartfelt. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wrote it for a single individual, someone she had come to care about as she grew older. Hitori would have never predicted she would feel this way about anyone in her life, but then again&hellip;was life ever predictable? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her friends didn&rsquo;t know about this, of course. They were friends, but she didn&rsquo;t tell them everything about herself, even after they had been together for this long. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naturally, she had no problem giving them the Zip Tie song, as it was simply created out of obligation and dedication to her band. But the other? She had written it in a subconscious moment of boldness, and now that it lay in her hands, she was tempted to throw it far away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the same time, she hesitated&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri would like it, wouldn&rsquo;t she?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c10">&ldquo;Shit. Why is this so tough?&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Hitori thought, grimacing hard. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had become more confident in these two years, but why didn&rsquo;t that also apply to her own courage? She could talk to others with more effort, but the thought of sharing embarrassing facets&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c10">I really ought to tell Kikuri-san to reconsider&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But no, Hitori couldn&rsquo;t do that. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She had come this far and invested so much time into preparing herself. Turning back was not an option anymore. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Hitori approached the nightclub, she let out a tired sigh. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ever since graduating high school, her days had become increasingly busy. Sure, she wasn&rsquo;t suffering as much as the others, who had college to deal with, but writing music late into the night and working various day jobs was no easy task. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was the support of her friends that kept her going these days. More specifically, it was the support 0f a certain person&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori reached the entrance of the nightclub, bass thumping against the walls, and paused for a moment to take a breath. The bouncer gave her a knowing look, and she stepped inside, instantly enveloped by the pulsating music. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A familiar mix of flashing color and nonstop movement greeted her as she navigated through the crowd. Her eyes scanned the room until she saw her friends standing near the bar. They were laughing and engaging in friendly conversation as she made her way over to them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bocchi-chan!&rdquo; Nijika exclaimed, enveloping her in a warm hug. &ldquo;It feels like it&#39;s been forever!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Actually, it&rsquo;s only been three days,&rdquo; Ryo said, taking a sip of her drink. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; Kita interjected. &ldquo;I wish it wasn&rsquo;t so hard for us to hang out regularly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;At least you guys know what you want to do. Unlike me.&rdquo; Hitori said, frowning. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nijika shook her head. &ldquo;Aw, it&rsquo;s no big deal, Bocchi-chan. Not everyone has to go to college to be happy. And I can&rsquo;t exactly say things are easy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an entirely different monster!&rdquo; Kita groaned. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think college would be so tough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right? But enough about us. How are you doing, Bocchi-chan?&rdquo; Nijika asked. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired,&rdquo; Hitori admitted. &ldquo;Balancing day work and songwriting is exhausting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nijika, Kita, and Ryo frowned in unison. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, well, I guess we&rsquo;re all tired these days.&rdquo; Nijika muttered. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They all let out exhausted sighs as the sound of a microphone filled the air, signaling the start of a performance. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori looked to the stage, her heart beating fast. Sick Hack was the main act tonight, and not once had she missed any of their recent concerts. The reason for that was actually quite simple. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori felt a swell of pride as she watched Kikuri Hiroi take the mic. The mere presence of the bassist on stage gave her goosebumps, and she hadn&rsquo;t even begun singing yet. This was why she had to be here. She had to see Kikuri, the girl she had come to care about more than anyone else for reasons she couldn&rsquo;t quite explain. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Sick Hack&rsquo;s loud melodies filled the air, complemented by Kikuri&rsquo;s husky singing voice, Hitori smiled with excitement. Kikuri always had a way of capturing the audience with her voice and actions, but the way she carried herself without alcohol made her aura feel even more powerful than usual. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On that stage, there was nothing special propelling her, nothing stimulating that distracted her, nothing that took her fears away. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri Hiroi was just herself. A little nervous, somewhat shy, but herself nonetheless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kikuri-san is seriously on another level,&rdquo; Nijika muttered in awe. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seika, who had also come to watch the concert, walked up to them with a satisfied look on her face. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s really something, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, she is,&rdquo; Hitori replied, her eyes fixed firmly on Kikuri. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s improved this much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seika smiled. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve been a big part of that, Bocchi-chan. Don&rsquo;t sell yourself short. Kikuri would never have changed her ways if it wasn&rsquo;t for you.&ldquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was nothing, really&hellip; She did all the hard work.&rdquo; Hitori said, blushing and shaking her head modestly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seika gave Hitori a gentle pat on the back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too humble. I tried many ways to convince her, but nothing ever worked. You managed to get through to her, and she&rsquo;s doing so much better as a result,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve noticed something else too. You&rsquo;ve become more confident yourself.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori turned to look at Seika, her eyes wide with surprise. &ldquo;Really? I wouldn&rsquo;t say that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seika shook her head. &ldquo;You absolutely have. Being around Kikuri must have really helped you. The fact that you&rsquo;re talking to me so willingly is proof of that. I can&rsquo;t even say you&rsquo;re the same girl who entered Starry all those years ago.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Onee-chan&rsquo;s right, Bocchi-chan. You&rsquo;ve become much stronger as a person.&rdquo; Nijika added with a smile. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori felt a surge of emotion, a mix of gratitude and realization. She hadn&rsquo;t noticed it herself, but Kikuri&rsquo;s presence had profoundly impacted her, changing her in ways she didn&rsquo;t expect. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She glanced back at the stage, where Kikuri was at her best, moving the crowd with her resonant voice. They made eye contact, and Kikuri threw up a peace sign with a grin. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori blushed, and a heartfelt look shone in her eyes, a look that didn&rsquo;t go unnoticed by her bandmates. </span></p><hr><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When Sick Hack&rsquo;s set came to an end, the crowd erupted into applause and cheers. Kikuri entertained the audience with various rock moves, her eyes searching the room until they landed on Hitori. With a sly grin, she made her way off the stage and over to where Hitori was standing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, you,&rdquo; Kikuri greeted, pulling Hitori into a tight hug. &ldquo;You never miss any of my performances, do you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori turned away, embarrassed by the very public display of affection, but Kikuri wasn&rsquo;t easily relenting. She pulled Hitori close with a teasing glint in her eye, whispering in her ear, &ldquo;You know, if you keep making such cute faces, it&rsquo;s going to be really hard for me to hold back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori&rsquo;s face flushed a deep shade of red, and she mumbled something incoherent, poorly attempting to hide her embarrassment. Kikuri laughed, planting a soft kiss on her cheek before letting her go. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so funny,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not drinking, but I feel so drunk and giddy because of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;S-stop it, Kikuri-san&hellip;&rdquo; Hitori murmured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still not used to this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kikuri pouted playfully. &ldquo;Aw, but you were the one who made me like this, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From a distance, Seika watched the exchange with an expression that was both thoughtful and apprehensive. On one hand, she was glad to see Kikuri so genuinely happy after she had been acting for so long. At the same time, she was slightly irked by the age gap between them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But despite all of that, she couldn&rsquo;t deny the positive impact that they clearly had on each other. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nijika, Kita, and Ryo had been watching too, and they were all blushing, their faces flushed with a mix of surprise and amusement. They had their suspicions, but this was the first time they had concrete confirmation of a relationship between the two&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you see that?&rdquo; Kita whispered excitedly. &ldquo;They kissed! They&rsquo;re totally in love!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryo nodded, her usual stoic expression softened by their earnest love. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite unexpected, though.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nijika grinned, nudging Hitori with a playful look as she returned. &ldquo;You two looked pretty cozy up there. Got something to share?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori stammered, her face still very bright red. &ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seika rolled her eyes with a smile. &ldquo;Honestly, Bocchi-chan, it&rsquo;s about time you two made things official.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They all gathered around a small table near the bar, chatting about the performance and this surprising new relationship. Kikuri walked over to join them, her hand brushing against Hitori&rsquo;s, a silent confirmation of their closeness. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, what next for Zip Tie, Nijika?&rdquo; Seika asked, looking around at the group with genuine interest. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nijika leaned back in her chair, a conflicted expression on her face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say,&rdquo; she said with a sigh. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re working on new material, but things have honestly been difficult, especially when balancing everything with college.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita nodded in agreement. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to find time to practice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah. I&rsquo;ve been writing new songs for us,&rdquo; Hitori added. &ldquo;But I often get swamped with work as well.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seika took a sip of her drink. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with taking a break once in a while,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;Take care of your work first and foremost. Then you&rsquo;ll have more time for Zip Tie.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Senpai&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Kikuri said with a serious expression. &ldquo;Music isn&rsquo;t fun if you&rsquo;re tired all the time. Trying to do both things at the same time is not a good idea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Seika eyed her in surprise and shook her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not used to this responsible side of you, Kikuri. It&rsquo;s very jarring.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kikuri chuckled. &ldquo;Well, you know who to thank for that, right?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Seika smiled, glancing at Hitori, who blushed. &ldquo;Yes, I suppose I do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kita looked at Kikuri and thought for a moment. &ldquo;Say&hellip;Kikuri-san&hellip;if you were normal all this time, why did you hide it behind all the drunkenness?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kikuri and Hitori exchanged resigned smiles. </span></p><hr><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As the night drew to a close, Kikuri and Hiroi found themselves lingering outside the club. The others had already gone home, leaving the two musicians behind in their own company. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kikuri wrapped an arm around Hitori&rsquo;s shoulders, pulling her close. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;I never thought I&rsquo;d be this happy without alcohol. You&rsquo;ve changed my life, Bocchi-chan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hitori looked up at Kikuri, her eyes shining with many emotions. Love, appreciation, pride, happiness, all of those and much more. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve changed mine too&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kikuri smiled and took her by the hand. &ldquo;So, are you feeling bold tonight?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;B-bold?&rdquo; Hitori stuttered in shock. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I suppose I should treat you? For various different reasons.&rdquo; Kikuri whispered with a sly grin. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hitori blushed and looked to the ground. She muttered something Kikuri couldn&rsquo;t quite hear. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What did you say, Bocchi-chan? I couldn&rsquo;t hear you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&hellip;I said&hellip;how far is your apartment from here?&rdquo; Hitori mumbled. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kikuri&rsquo;s grin grew wider and she pulled the shy girl along. &ldquo;Close enough,&rdquo; she whispered. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hitori leaned into Kikuri, feeling a warmth that went beyond the physical touch. Kikuri had revealed a new side of herself that was both surprising and liberating. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And at the same time, Hitori had also saved the bassist from her own demons, giving her a sense of pride in her actions that made her happy. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Tonight, she would show her heartfelt lyrics to Kikuri and see what she thought of them&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hitori just hoped she would have the courage.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As they walked, the city and its sounds seemed to fade away, leaving just the two of them in their own world of love and camaraderie. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kikuri eyed Hitori with a look of gratitude, feeling thankful for her breaking the chains that had been holding her down for so many years. Of course, the endless path of therapy sessions and rehab appointments were grueling and painful, but Hitori&rsquo;s encouragement kept her going through all of it. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She wouldn&rsquo;t stop trying. If not for herself, for Hitori Gotoh, who tried so hard for her sake.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kikuri chuckled, thinking about something she hadn&rsquo;t thought of in a long time. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When was the last time she put on a play?</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
