And it hadn&rsquo;t been long since she graduated from &ldquo;water flea&rdquo; to &ldquo;above-average water flea&rdquo; by having three great friends. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>But little by little, a virus had infected her &ldquo;flea-brain&rdquo;, a terrible virus known as </span><span class="c8">stress</span><span class="c1">. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, Hitori Gotoh was no stranger to stress. It was basically her best friend, her worst enemy, and she could never get rid of it. Did she want to talk to someone? Nope, stress sewed her mouth shut instantly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But she had never experienced this kind of stress. This madness that made her feel like shit (more than usual) and go blank.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the first sign. She lost her notes, her rhythm. Then the freeze happened. Her body wouldn&rsquo;t move, wouldn&rsquo;t budge. Her fingers, her most important asset as a musician, were stuck in place. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori Gotoh freaked out. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How could she lose her ability to play so easily? How could she be so stupid? What if she never found her inner self again?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oh god, what would her bandmates think? She could just picture it&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">&rdquo;Sorry, Bocchi-chan. You&rsquo;re great and all, but you have no use without your ability to play.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">&rdquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Gotoh-San. I can find another teacher, and you can focus on your YouTube channel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c5">&rdquo;A musician is no good without their abilities, Bocchi. I&rsquo;ll ask someone else for money from now on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gah! Hitori just couldn&rsquo;t take it. Sure, that last one was actually pretty appealing&hellip; but the others weren&rsquo;t. She didn&rsquo;t want to hear her bandmates&mdash;her friends&mdash;say things like that. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And what&rsquo;s a good way to avoid hearing what you don&rsquo;t want to hear? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Running away, of course!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">(not really, but this is Hitori &ldquo;Bocchi&rdquo; Gotoh we&rsquo;re talking about)</span></p><hr><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Kessoku</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Band didn&rsquo;t know where Hitori Gotoh was. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>To be fair, she </span><span class="c5">was</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the kind of person to seclude herself in a corner, only to reappear with endless apologies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this time felt different. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was simply no reason for her to disappear; she had communicated with them the previous day. Then, without any sort of warning, and like a mist in the wind, she vanished. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nijika paced back and forth on the stage of Club Starry. Her drumsticks were clicking every second, like a droning metronome. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Has Bocchi-chan replied yet?&rdquo; she asked for the fifth time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Kita, who sat nearby with a frown, shook her head. &ldquo;No. She keeps leaving me </span><span>on read</span><span class="c1">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aah, I&rsquo;m so worried!&rdquo; Nijika cried. &ldquo;Where could she be?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Across the room, Ryo leaned against a chair, her phone in one hand and a half-eaten bag of chips in the other. &ldquo;Relax, Nijika,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Bocchi is fine.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ryo, you don&rsquo;t seem concerned at all,&rdquo; Nijika said with a frown. &ldquo;What if something&rsquo;s happened to Bocchi-chan?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryo lowered her phone and sighed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s probably gone for a good reason.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What reason?&rdquo; Nijika demanded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;A mood,&rdquo; Ryo said simply.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Mood?&rdquo; Kita echoed, tilting her head. &ldquo;Wait, do you think it&rsquo;s </span><span class="c5">that</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;time of the month&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Ryo stopped her before she went further. &ldquo;</span><span>Not that</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;kind of mood,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t get it, Ikuyo. It&rsquo;s a musician thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;A </span><span class="c5">musician thing</span><span>?&rdquo; Nijika raised an eyebrow, her doubt evident. &ldquo;Then how come </span><span class="c5">I</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;don&rsquo;t know about it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Musicians&rsquo; secrets,&rdquo; Ryo said cryptically, stuffing another chip into her mouth. &ldquo;I might tell you if you pay me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will not!&rdquo; Nijika exclaimed, crossing her arms indignantly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Even if Bocchi-chan had a good reason to disappear, wouldn&rsquo;t she have told us?&rdquo; Kita asked, her voice soft with worry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryo&rsquo;s expression turned distant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;In these kinds of moods,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;you lose all sense of reason.&rdquo;</span></p><hr><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori knew this was foolish. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn&rsquo;t help it. Her mind and body had acted on impulse in the face of her distress. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How could she lose the ability to play so suddenly? Was she stupid? After playing for years, losing it all was truly the worst. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was just thankful that Ryo was understanding. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was a strange feeling to have for the leech Ryo of all people, but Hitori understood it. Ryo was like her, not in the &ldquo;introverted loser&rdquo; sense, but in the sense that they were both dedicated musicians of their craft. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Except, now Hitori had lost that part of herself. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For several long minutes, she looked out at the ocean with a pensive look, her arms resting on an old metal railing. Her guitar was on her back, but she was scared to play it, scared to feel that hopelessness again. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If she lost her lifeline, what would be left of her? A gross pink shell?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No one would want her then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori took a slow deep breath and closed her eyes. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">She could feel the wind rustling above her, hear the faint sounds of the city around her, and smell the delicious wafts of nearby restaurants.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The scenery engulfed her, soothed her in strange ways, until all sense of tension melted out of her body.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Then she found that the tension was being replaced with memories, flashes of the good times she spent with her bandmates, the days when she first found joy in making music, and the endless hours she took learning how to use her father&rsquo;s guitar.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">All of this was mixed with the heavy smell of sea salt. When she considered everything, music truly brought her the greatest joy, didn&rsquo;t it? She had forgotten the truth of that, but here in this faraway place, she was in an extremely introspective mood.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Of course, Hitori was always an introspective person, she was always thinking deeply about herself, but never to this extent.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Hitori didn&rsquo;t know how long she sat there, lost in her thoughts, but something inside her was stirring. A small, fragile voice grew louder and whispered, </span><span class="c5">Pick up the guitar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a voice she hadn&rsquo;t heard in years, ever since she first became a musician. But it was also a voice she trusted, a voice that helped her through the roughest times in her life&hellip; </span></p><p class="c0"><span>And so hesitantly</span><span class="c1">, she reached for her case, her hands trembling. &ldquo;Just one song,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Just&hellip; one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>As her fingers slowly touched the strings, she began a tentative acoustic of </span><span class="c5">If I Became A Constellation</span><span>.</span><span class="c5 c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was imperfect and shaky at first, but as the song continued, everything came back to her. Before long, she was playing better than she had in quite some time. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori sighed and placed her guitar back in its bag with a shake of her head. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why am I like this?&rdquo; she asked in exasperation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so stupid. I didn&rsquo;t even need to run away in the first place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori pulled out her phone, prepared to contact her friends for the first time in a few hours, but what she saw surprised her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Geh!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One hundred notifications. Maybe Hitori wasn&rsquo;t an above-average water flea after all, for making her friends worry this much. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She ran back to the train station as fast as she could, hoping her friends wouldn&rsquo;t be angry with her on the other side.</span></p><hr><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as she stepped off the train car, Hitori was surrounded by her bandmates. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nijika was tearful, Kita was worried, and Ryo was&hellip; well, Ryo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bocchi-chan, where have you been?&rdquo; Nijika cried, hugging her. &ldquo;We were so worried&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I told Ryo-San to tell you not to worry,&rdquo; Hitori mumbled, glancing at her. &ldquo;Did she&hellip; not tell you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;She </span><span class="c5">may</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;have mentioned it&hellip;&rdquo; Nijika said, giving Ryo a slow glare. &ldquo;But I was under the distinct impression that none of us could contact you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wanted to be alone&hellip;&rdquo; Hitori muttered. &ldquo;If I told any of you where I was&hellip; you would have come to find me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alone? What for?&rdquo; Nijika asked curiously. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I just&hellip; needed a break,&rdquo; Hitori muttered, scratching her head sheepishly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A break?&rdquo; Nijika repeated, her voice tinged with hurt. &ldquo;From us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, not from you,&rdquo; Hitori hurried to clarify. &ldquo;Just&hellip; from everything else&hellip; maybe you wouldn&rsquo;t understand&hellip; It&#39;s a musician thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why does everyone keep saying this?&rdquo; Nijika cried, throwing her hands up in exasperation. &ldquo;It explains nothing!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess you just don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; Ryo said with a shrug, earning herself a sharp glare from Nijika. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; Nijika said, her voice low and ominous. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get it? Enlighten me, Ryo&mdash;what is this </span><span class="c5">&lsquo;musician thing&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;I keep hearing about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryo, predictably, pretended not to hear her. &quot;So, Bocchi,&quot; she said casually, narrowly avoiding Nijika&rsquo;s red-hot stare, &quot;next time, maybe let everyone know where you&rsquo;re going instead of keeping it a secret.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori frowned, shrinking into herself. &ldquo;Sorry&hellip;&rdquo; she mumbled. &ldquo;I should have just told you&hellip; I really am stupid&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita stepped forward then, cupping Hitori&rsquo;s face in her hands. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not stupid, Hitori-chan,&rdquo; she exclaimed with a knowing look. &ldquo;In fact, you&rsquo;re one of the coolest people I know. But we were all worried about you. Next time, please don&rsquo;t feel like you have to go through things alone, okay?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori nodded, a small smile forming on her face. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do something like this again&hellip; hopefully.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nijika crossed her arms, releasing the tension with a long sigh. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; she said, her tone a mixture of relief and lingering exasperation. &ldquo;You had us scared out of our minds, Bocchi-chan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Speak for yourself,&rdquo; Ryo said lazily. &ldquo;I knew she&rsquo;d come back eventually. Still, you owe us something for all of this trouble. Some free lunch, perhaps?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori&rsquo;s smile grew a little. Ryo&rsquo;s suggestion, frustrating as it was, felt like an odd return to normalcy. &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; she said softly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As the four of them began to make their way out of the station, the weight on Hitori&rsquo;s shoulders seemed a bit lighter. She knew the source of her troubles&mdash;stress and self-doubt could crush anyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there was no reason for her to face it alone. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All she needed was a little peace, a quiet reminder of why she loved music in the first place, and the knowledge that her friends would always be worried about her. </span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
