Compared to most maids here, she stood out due to her short orange hair and firm look. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But she looked firm for a reason. It was the early morning, and she hated mornings. How could one do their best work if they&rsquo;re tired?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She entered the dining hall for servants and walked over to a countertop in the staff kitchen. She poured a bag of cocoa beans into the grinder and began the slow, tedious process of making manual coffee. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>It hadn&rsquo;t been long since </span><sup><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c0">coffee was introduced to the land, but for Nadia, it was practically her lifeline. She did her best work with full energy. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She sat down in one of the dining chairs, taking a sip of the hot drink. For as large of a fad coffee was becoming, there were still plenty who couldn&rsquo;t stand the flavorless taste. Teas had been all the rage for years, but this new drink required much more of a specific palette. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia was one of those who adopted it immediately. She loved drinking coffee straight black, no milk, no added flavorings. It was better that way, she thought, for instantly sending you into work mode. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Except, work for Nadia meant two different things depending on the situation. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As she continued to sip, another maid entered the room and eyed her with a grin. &ldquo;Good morning, Nadia.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia nodded. &ldquo;Morning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Madeline sat next to her with a knowing look. &ldquo;You know, you&rsquo;ve really become something of an enigma amongst the other maids,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No one&rsquo;s managed to get as close to Lady Willow as you have.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia shrugged with a sip of her coffee. &ldquo;Guess we get along well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Madeline eyed her curiously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how that can be,&rdquo; she noted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always been sort of&hellip; distant with us. But I suppose with the mistress, you do&hellip; seem more lively.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia stood up and shook her head, coffee in hand. &ldquo;My lady likes good company, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; she said sharply. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why everyone&rsquo;s so surprised.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She finished the rest of her coffee before Madeline could respond and left the room. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Do I really seem more lively with her?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia shook her head. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c6">No, they&rsquo;re wrong about that&hellip; I&rsquo;m just&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c6 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her fingers brushed against her dress, feeling the outline of the knife strapped beneath it. It was a small knife, but one sharp enough to cause bloodshed with even the briefest of touches. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How long had she been at this estate, stationed for a mission she could barely remember the details of?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Under normal circumstances she would have finished her work and left already. But why was it that she couldn&rsquo;t do it? </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia made a small smile. She knew why, of course. There was a clear reason, obvious to her, why she was facing hesitation. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nadia,&rdquo; greeted a blonde-haired girl with a bright smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great morning, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This girl, whose name was Willow, was Nadia&rsquo;s master, the daughter of this estate, and the one who, regretfully, Nadia was supposed to kill. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And she couldn&rsquo;t. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good morning, my lady,&rdquo; Nadia bowed dutifully. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t wait for me again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always so slow, Nadia,&rdquo; she teased. &ldquo;Who would have thought that my handmaid wasn&rsquo;t a morning person?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My apologies,&rdquo; Nadia bowed again. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t have to apologize,&rdquo; Willow assured. &ldquo;Now, shall we head out? There&rsquo;s a lot of work to do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, my lady,&rdquo; Nadia nodded with a frown. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For the amount of months Nadia had been there at the estate, she had come to develop a sort of friendship with Willow. Of course, they were far apart, being a noble lady and a maid, but they seemed to get along well. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia didn&rsquo;t know why she found herself drawn to Willow. Everything about her was almost antithetical to what she had been taught. A good assassin never got close to the bright, cheerful types. It was a dangerous path; Nadia knew that all too well. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they entered the study, Nadia watched as Willow settled into her chair and began sorting through documents on her desk. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was something about the way Willow did her work. She seemed so innocent, but at the same time, she dealt with complex business operations on a scale that Nadia couldn&rsquo;t even imagine. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there were so many opportunities, too. First, Willow was exposed when she was engrossed in reading, making any attacks easy and unavoidable. Second, it was easy to bring tea to Willow during her work, and Willow wouldn&rsquo;t question it, meaning someone could slip poison in there without issue. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But despite all of that, despite the fact that she could end her mission there, Nadia couldn&rsquo;t do it. Even as her fingers shook and she rubbed the knife concealed in her dress, even as she brought a fresh cup of tea for her master, she just couldn&rsquo;t kill her. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia sighed and went to do her daily chores.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t work too hard, Nadia,&rdquo; Willow called over the endless stacks of papers. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia nodded in the doorway. &ldquo;Yes, my lady.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia carried a basket of fresh laundry outside and hung it up on the line to dry. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was a nice warm breeze blowing that afternoon, perfect for cleaning. Basking in the calm atmosphere of the outdoors, Nadia took a deep breath. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This was probably her weakness. She hadn&rsquo;t realized it, being an assassin for so long, but doing housework such as this was very relaxing. Sure, it was tough and grueling at times, but compared to assassinations&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was simply no comparison. And for some strange reason, taking care of her lady Willow was enjoyable; it brought her great pride. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You could have left some of this work to the other maids.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia turned to see Madeline walking up with another basket of laundry. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why would I do that?&rdquo; Nadia asked. &ldquo;I like doing work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Madeline chuckled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably the only person in this entire estate who&rsquo;d ever say that,&rdquo; she said as she hung some clothes on the line. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t see it as just work. It&rsquo;s&hellip; different.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Different how?&rdquo; Madeline asked, her curiosity piqued.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia paused, considering her words. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about the chores themselves. It&rsquo;s about the purpose behind them. When I do this,&rdquo; she gestured toward the clothesline, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not just cleaning. I&rsquo;m taking care of someone. It feels&hellip; worthwhile.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Madeline glanced at her, her expression softening. &ldquo;You really care about Lady Willow, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia hesitated for a moment, her fingers lingering on the hem of a dress she was hanging. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s... important,&rdquo; she said quietly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Madeline gave her a knowing look but said nothing further, letting the moment settle between them. The two worked in companionable silence for a while, the only sounds being the gentle rustle of fabric in the wind and the occasional chirping of birds.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they finished, Nadia stepped back to admire the sight of the freshly washed clothes billowing in the sunlight. It was a small thing, but it brought her a sense of accomplishment.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet in the back of her mind, the other side of her life lingered like a shadow. For just how long could she hold onto this sense of normalcy? How long could she balance being both a devoted maid and a reluctant assassin?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a sigh, Nadia picked up her basket and headed back towards the estate.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the end of her busy day, Willow sat looking up at the night sky from the balcony of her bedroom. She was frowning, though Nadia hesitated to inquire as to why. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nadia, do you ever feel like&hellip; escaping?&rdquo; Willow asked as Nadia poured fresh tea into her cup.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia tilted her head. &ldquo;Escaping?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow nodded. &ldquo;Yes. Has there ever been a time where you&rsquo;ve simply wanted to free yourself? To let go of everything you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia looked to the floor. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never thought about that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow nodded. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s not a normal thing to think about,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard, having expectations, serving a family I never see, being&hellip; a tool.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia&rsquo;s eyes went wide. &ldquo;...a tool?&rdquo; She knew that all too well. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow laughed, but it was a cold, emotionless laugh. &ldquo;Why do you think I do so much work all the time?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My parents use me to do all the dirty work they don&rsquo;t care for.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia frowned. That sounded even more like what she knew. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But&hellip; isn&rsquo;t this the life you were born into? Isn&rsquo;t this&hellip; normal?&rdquo; she asked, more for herself than Willow. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow shook her head. &ldquo;I was born to serve this family,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;But this isn&rsquo;t the life I want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Born to serve.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;That phrase resonated with Nadia on a deep level. She had been born to serve the Order all her life, and so she accepted that as her given role, but lately she wondered whether that was truly what she wanted. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the same time&hellip; could she even escape this life she was practically groomed into? </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What kind of life do you want, my lady?&rdquo; Nadia asked curiously.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A peaceful one,&rdquo; Willow responded with a smile. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Peaceful?&rdquo; Nadia repeated. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Willow nodded. &ldquo;A life where the choices I make are my own, where I&rsquo;m free from this&hellip; endless monotony.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia thought for a second. &ldquo;But&hellip; is it possible to be&hellip; free?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow looked to the ground. &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c3">So she thinks it&rsquo;s possible&hellip; is it really?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c6 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The balcony was left in silence as Nadia pondered her words. Long ago she had considered the idea of escape&hellip; but she decided there was no point in it. She was born to be an assassin, so why do anything else? </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other hand&hellip; was there a chance?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s getting late,&rdquo; Willow said, rising from her chair with a stretch. &ldquo;Can you draw me a bath, Nadia?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia nodded, pulled from her turbulent thoughts. &ldquo;Of course, my lady.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they reentered the estate, Nadia went into the bathroom and warmed up the bath. Then she rejoined her master in her bedroom, helping her undress. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done a lot of work today,&rdquo; Willow said with a yawn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so tired.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow&rsquo;s clothes dropping to the floor, Nadia couldn&rsquo;t help but stare. She wasn&rsquo;t used to acknowledging the appeal of others, nor the feelings of fascination. But that all changed when she met Willow. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Something about her form was&hellip; attractive to the eye. It was like she had the right amount of everything. Unfortunately, Nadia had made it a bad habit to stare at her master like this, in improper ways. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You seem fascinated, Nadia,&rdquo; Willow said teasingly, with a hint of pink on her cheeks. &ldquo;Feeling curious?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;N-no, of course not,&rdquo; Nadia said quickly. &ldquo;My apologies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow sighed. &ldquo;Apologizing again?&rdquo; She wrapped a towel around herself as they walked to the bathroom. &ldquo;Loosen up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; Nadia muttered.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they entered the bathroom, steam from the toasty water filled the air. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nice and warm,&rdquo; Willow said, feeling the water with her hand. &ldquo;Join me, Nadia.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Nadia took a step back as Willow approached her, dropping her towel, forgoing all sense of modesty. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Take a bath with me!&rdquo; Willow said, pulling Nadia&rsquo;s maid clothes off before she could protest. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;B-but we&rsquo;re maid and master!&rdquo; Nadia exclaimed, holding herself as she was only in her undergarments now. Surprisingly enough, Willow hadn&rsquo;t acknowledged the noticeable scars all over her body. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And as your master, I order you to join me,&rdquo; Willow said, pointing at her. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia groaned and then sighed. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Y-yes, my lady,&rdquo; she mumbled, removing her garments with a flush. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now sitting together in the hot bath, Nadia and Willow made sighs of relaxation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;See? This isn&rsquo;t so bad, is it?&rdquo; Willow said with a smile. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Y-you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Nadia muttered.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they washed and soaked, she stared over at Willow, who was nearly melting in the warm water. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her form was blinding, a light she couldn&rsquo;t help being drawn to. Willow was simply a girl that seemed a child at heart and took things in stride, but why was that so fascinating to Nadia? </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She knew this wasn&rsquo;t right, of course she shouldn&rsquo;t feel this way towards her lady. Not when she was meant to hate her. Not when she was supposed to fulfill the mission she was hired for. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But how could she&hellip;how could she take the life of someone like this?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you alright, Nadia?&rdquo; Willow asked curiously, noticing her solemn gaze. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip;&rdquo; Nadia hesitated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine. Just a little tired, that&rsquo;s all&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow stared at her, not buying her words. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia felt her hands twitch. She knew this feeling, it was the same tick that occurred whenever she had to hurt someone that didn&rsquo;t deserve it. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You look troubled,&rdquo; Willow noticed with a sigh. &ldquo;Why is it that you always seem so distant? I&rsquo;m willing to listen if something&rsquo;s bothering you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; Nadia assured. &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow frowned. &ldquo;...I see.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Though the water was relaxing, the rest of the bath was spent in a tense quiet that just wouldn&rsquo;t go away. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia tied up her still-wet hair as she sat outside the estate, waiting. It was nearly midnight now, when everyone else was sleeping, but Nadia hardly ever slept. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, a dark figure jumped down from some nearby trees, hooded and masked. He eyed her with a cold stare that might petrify a normal person. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Nadia crossed her arms impatiently.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nadia, why aren&rsquo;t you completing your task?&rdquo; the assassin asked. &ldquo;Your completion times are growing further apart with each passing day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working on it,&rdquo; Nadia snapped. &ldquo;Tell Rino to get off my back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s gotten tired of your excuses,&rdquo; the assassin said in mock sadness, pulling out a knife. &ldquo;My orders were to&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The assassin couldn&rsquo;t finish his sentence, as a knife lodged itself directly in between his wide eyes. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia caught him as he fell, to avoid any loud noise. &ldquo;This is the third one this month,&rdquo; she sighed. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hoisting his lifeless body onto her shoulder, she prepared to head into the nearby forest, where a lake led out into the ocean; a convenient place to throw unwanted trash.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But as she began to walk, Nadia looked up and froze. For a split second, she could have sworn she saw the light of a candle in an upstairs bedroom. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But she shook her head. It was probably nothing. She kept walking.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow sat beneath a birch white garden gazebo, the soft sunlight highlighting her features. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia sat across from her, watching as she took a sip of tea from a cup. She dutifully refilled the cup with trained movements.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you, Nadia.&rdquo; Willow said, glancing at her with a knowing look. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course, my lady.&rdquo; Nadia nodded, before staring down at her own tea cup. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It hadn&rsquo;t been long since Willow invited her to join in having tea, but Nadia still wasn&rsquo;t used to it. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maids having tea with their masters was blasphemous, and on top of that&hellip; Nadia had ulterior motives. All of this was wrong. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But why was it that she did it anyway?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow&rsquo;s gaze was unwavering, her sharp blue eyes tracing Nadia&rsquo;s every movement. Finally, she spoke, her tone light yet probing. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been awfully quiet today, Nadia.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia&rsquo;s fingers tightened imperceptibly around her cup&rsquo;s handle, but her face remained composed. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t aware that I was much of a talker, my lady,&rdquo; she replied, a hint of levity in her voice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow smiled faintly, setting her teacup down with a deliberate clink. &ldquo;Nadia,&rdquo; she said after a moment, her voice gentler this time, almost coaxing. &ldquo;Why did you choose to work here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a simple question, but for Nadia, it was an impossible one to answer. She took a slow, shaky sip of her tea, before setting it down on the table. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To serve you, of course, my lady,&rdquo; Nadia said finally, her tone careful, neutral.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow&rsquo;s expression softened, but her piercing gaze remained locked on Nadia. &ldquo;No, I mean why you&rsquo;re really here,&rdquo; she said, her voice calm yet full of weight.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia&rsquo;s hands twitched slightly. Did she know? Her mind raced through countless possibilities, weighing each outcome in an instant. She could deny it, or she could feign ignorance, or she could do what she was sent for&hellip;elimination. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But as she met Willow&rsquo;s eyes, the resolve in them paralyzed her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; just serving your best interests, my lady,&rdquo; Nadia said cautiously, her voice steady despite the turmoil in her chest.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow tilted her head, studying Nadia like a puzzle. &quot;You don&rsquo;t have to lie to me, Nadia. I&rsquo;ve seen enough to piece it together. The strange scars, the way you carry yourself, the times you&rsquo;ve disappeared into the night... and the occasional glint of something sharp beneath your skirts.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With deliberate care, Willow leaned forward and rested her hand&mdash;soft, delicate&mdash;on the exact spot where Nadia had hidden her blade. Nadia&rsquo;s breath caught in her throat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You were sent here to kill me, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Willow said.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia felt her breath hitch in her throat. She had spent countless nights anticipating scenarios in which Willow discovered her secret, yet none of them prepared her for the way Willow&#39;s voice trembled&mdash;a tone of voice that was rare.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;And yet,&quot; Willow continued softly, &quot;you haven&rsquo;t. Why is that?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia opened her mouth to respond, but no words came. She looked down, her knuckles turning white from the amount of force she was applying to them from clenching her fists. She couldn&#39;t bring herself to meet Willow&#39;s gaze any longer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why hadn&rsquo;t she done it? The question stuck in her mind all the time, haunting her like an unwanted scab. All her life she had been trained for unmitigated assassination, but everytime an opportunity appeared&hellip; she hesitated. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I...&quot; Nadia hesitated, her voice barely a whisper. &quot;I don&rsquo;t know.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow leaned back in her chair, her delicate fingers interlaced in her lap. &quot;You&rsquo;ve had plenty of chances. I&rsquo;ve even given you some, though maybe you didn&rsquo;t notice.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Nadia&rsquo;s head shot up, her eyes wide. &quot;You&hellip; </span><span class="c3">what</span><span class="c0">?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow smiled faintly, though it didn&rsquo;t reach her eyes. &quot;Did you think I wouldn&rsquo;t notice someone like you? You&rsquo;re always so quiet, so precise. You&rsquo;re different from the other maids. At first, I thought it was just your personality, but then...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She trailed off, her gaze drifting toward the garden around them. &quot;I started noticing the little things. The way you move, the way you watch everything, the scars you think are hidden&hellip;&rdquo; She gestured faintly toward Nadia&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;And the way you always carry that satchel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia clenched her fists. She should have been more careful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But, despite all of that,&quot; Willow said, her voice softening again, &quot;I don&rsquo;t feel unsafe around you. In fact...&quot; She hesitated, her cheeks tinged with a faint blush. &quot;I feel the opposite.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat. &quot;My lady, I...&quot; She struggled to form a coherent response, but Willow raised a hand to stop her.<br></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&rsquo;t need you to explain,&quot; Willow said. &quot;Not yet. I just need to know one thing.&quot; She leaned forward, her blue eyes boring into Nadia&rsquo;s with an intensity that made it impossible to look away. &quot;If you were given the order right now, could you kill me?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia froze. Her mind screamed at her to say yes, to maintain her cover, to prove her loyalty to the Order. But her heart&mdash;that traitorous organ of hers&mdash;betrayed her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No,&quot; she admitted, her voice barely audible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For a moment, there was only silence between them, broken only by the distant chirping of birds and the rustle of leaves in the breeze.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow smiled, a genuine smile this time, filled with relief. &quot;I thought as much,&quot; she said softly. &ldquo;Though I didn&rsquo;t always.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia&rsquo;s chest tightened. &ldquo;But&hellip; Why, my lady? Why would you put yourself in harm&rsquo;s way? Why would you trust me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow took a sip of tea and stared at her cup with a distant look. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she said after a moment, &ldquo;I wanted to see if you were worth trusting. Or maybe&hellip;&rdquo; She hesitated, her lips curving into a bittersweet smile. &ldquo;Maybe I didn&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia&rsquo;s breath hitched. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow looked back at her, and for the first time, Nadia saw the weight her mistress carried&mdash;the loneliness, the weariness hidden behind perfect manners and polite smiles. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Do you remember when I asked you about escaping?&rdquo; Willow whispered. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t talking about running away from this estate. I meant </span><span class="c3">me</span><span>. </span><span class="c3">This life.</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The words struck a chord deep within Nadia. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered, shaking her head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t kill someone like you, my lady. I&rsquo;ve done terrible things, but this&hellip; I just can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow put a hand up to Nadia&rsquo;s cheek. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pretty crummy assassin, aren&rsquo;t you, Nadia?&rdquo; she said softly with a smile. &ldquo;I would have assumed that you killed countless people before me without issue, but maybe I was wrong?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia flinched at the words, her gaze dropping to the ground. &ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to talk about that.&rdquo; Her voice came as a whisper, barely more than breath. &ldquo;Not with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow nodded, accepting the boundary without argument. &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I would like to see your satchel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia blinked, her brow furrowing. &ldquo;My satchel?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow&rsquo;s lips curved faintly upward. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I keep my&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tools?&rdquo; Willow finished, her voice tinged with curiosity. &ldquo;I know. I&rsquo;d still like to see them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Suspicion flared in Nadia&rsquo;s chest. She hesitated, clutching at the familiar weight of the bag hanging from her shoulder. &ldquo;You&hellip; </span><span class="c3">want</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to see?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow nodded again, patient as ever.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Reluctantly, Nadia sighed, placing her satchel on the table with deliberate care, her hands lingering on its worn leather, as though the act of passing it over was physically painful for her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow immediately began to look through it with strange interest. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is fascinating,&rdquo; she said, observing knives and small deadly bottles. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like any one of these objects could cause death instantly.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia frowned. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the point.&rdquo; she whispered. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow thought for a moment and nodded. &ldquo;I suppose you could have slipped this in my tea today and your mission would have ended,&rdquo; she said, swirling a deadly bottle. &ldquo;Or one of these knives could have been used while I was bathing or in bed at night&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then she pulled out a small notebook that made Nadia flinch. &ldquo;And what is this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia snatched the book from her hand and held it close to herself. &ldquo;This is where I&hellip; keep the names,&rdquo; she muttered, stuffing it back into the satchel. &ldquo;I write them, so I remember the terrible things I&rsquo;ve done. Your name&hellip; I haven&rsquo;t written it yet, but&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to kill you, my lady. I really don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow smiled. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t want to do any more of my family&rsquo;s dirty work either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia tilted her head. &ldquo;What are you trying to say, my lady?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow reached for Nadia&rsquo;s hands, prying one free from the death grip it had on the notebook. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s run away, Nadia. Just you and me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Nadia&rsquo;s eyes were wide. &ldquo;But&hellip; how?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We can take a train,&rdquo; Willow suggested, like it was an obvious fact. &ldquo;If we ride enough of them, we&rsquo;ll be far enough away that no one can follow us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And if they do?&rdquo; Nadia asked, her voice barely more than a whisper.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; Willow glanced towards the open satchel with a grin. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an assassin, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia let out a shaky laugh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not making sense,&rdquo; she said, her voice breaking. &ldquo;Why me? Why do you place so much trust in me, even though I was supposed to kill you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because you didn&rsquo;t kill me,&rdquo; Willow said simply. &ldquo;If you weren&rsquo;t who you are, then I would probably be dead by now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia frowned, tears twinkling in her eyes. &ldquo;Can I&hellip;?&rdquo; she began, her voice soft. &ldquo;Can I really run away? Is it truly possible to escape?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow squeezed her hands, her smile radiant and unwavering. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we find out?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Willow, I&rsquo;m home!&rdquo; Willow&rsquo;s father called, his deep voice resonating through the grand manor. &ldquo;Willow?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A maid, hurried and flustered, dashed into the entryway to greet him. She fumbled with her skirts, dropping into an awkward curtsy. &ldquo;M-My lord,&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;We&hellip; we didn&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;d be returning so soon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His brow furrowed, his voice sharpening like a blade. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Willow?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The maid hesitated, her gaze darting to the polished floor as if the answers were etched in the tiles. &ldquo;She&hellip; she ran away, my lord,&rdquo; she murmured, barely audible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; His voice thundered through the halls. &ldquo;She did what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Miles away, aboard a passenger steam train cutting through rolling hills and open fields, Willow and Nadia sat together in a private compartment.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My lady, are you sure about this?&rdquo; Nadia asked, her voice uncertain as she fidgeted with the hem of her sleeve.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow turned to her, her lips curling into a slight pout. &ldquo;I thought I told you to call me by my name,&rdquo; she chided gently. &ldquo;And yes, I&rsquo;m absolutely sure. Don&rsquo;t you want to leave the past behind, too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia nodded hesitantly. &ldquo;I&hellip; I do,&rdquo; she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Willow said, her tone resolute. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we burned your journal, Nadia. Every name, every painful memory&mdash;it&rsquo;s gone. The past is ashes now. It&rsquo;s time for us to look ahead, to build something new.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia took a deep breath and made a small smile. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But&hellip; where are we even going?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow&rsquo;s lips curved into a mysterious smile. &ldquo;A nice, quiet city,&rdquo; she replied.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia tilted her head, skepticism slipping into her tone. &ldquo;You talk as though you&rsquo;ve already been there.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I have, once upon a time,&rdquo; Willow said, her voice warm with reminiscence. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little house there that I bought for this purpose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia&rsquo;s eyes went wide. &ldquo;You already bought a house?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Willow replied, her confidence unwavering. &ldquo;This was always my plan&mdash;to leave everything behind. You&hellip;&rdquo; She paused, her cheeks flushing faintly. &ldquo;You just happened to be a wonderful addition that made everything so much better.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia&rsquo;s face turned scarlet, and she looked away, fiddling with her fingers. &ldquo;But&hellip; I haven&rsquo;t done anything to&mdash;&ldquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow suddenly pressed a gentle, lingering kiss to Nadia&rsquo;s lips, cutting her off. &ldquo;There you go again, devaluing yourself,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you see the value that I see in you?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia&rsquo;s blush deepened, but her lips quivered into the faintest of smiles.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Maybe&hellip;&rdquo; she began hesitantly, her voice trembling as she looked into Willow&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;maybe you can help me understand.&rdquo; She swallowed hard, summoning a courage she didn&rsquo;t know she had, and reached out, her hands trembling as she gently pulled Willow into another kiss.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The moment stretched between them, fragile and full of promise, as the world outside the train blurred into streaks of light and shadow. When Nadia finally pulled away, her decision was made.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She chose freedom.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Several months later, in a small cozy townhouse, Willow and Nadia were spending a nice evening together. The home, though modest, had become their sanctuary&mdash;a place where the weight of their pasts couldn&rsquo;t reach them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It took a while for them to get used to their new surroundings, but in the process, they grew closer together. Nadia found herself discovering parts of herself she hadn&rsquo;t known existed. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And before she realized it, their companionship had transformed into something far more profound. They were no longer just allies or companions. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet even in their peaceful haven, Willow had a way of pulling Nadia into her playful antics. That evening was no exception.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Both bare beneath the dim, golden glow of their bedroom candles, Willow observed Nadia&rsquo;s form with a mixture of warmth and longing. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Nadia, you&#39;re so beautiful,&quot; she whispered, her lips curving into a smile. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A flush crept up Nadia&rsquo;s neck and she looked away. &quot;That&#39;s not true...&quot; she mumbled. &quot;You look better than I do.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow laughed. &quot;For an emotionless assassin, you sure are embarrassed easily,&quot; she teased.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia flinched as Willow&rsquo;s fingers began to explore, tracing the faint scars that lined her pale body. She lingered on each one, as if searching for some long held history within them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You have so many scars&hellip;&rdquo; Willow muttered. As her fingers fluttered over her, a spark seemed to hit Nadia. She couldn&rsquo;t help but whimper. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aah&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Willow smiled, her face full of affection. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re beautiful </span><span class="c3">and</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;cute,&rdquo; she whispered, before leaning down to kiss her. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ahn&hellip; you don&rsquo;t have to&hellip;&rdquo; Nadia whispered, her voice trembling. &ldquo;Ahn&hellip; kiss them all&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Willow said, her eyes deep and intoxicated. &ldquo;But I want to see every part of you, Nadia.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For an assassin who was only trained in combat, this was new territory for Nadia, but unlike learning combat for the first time, this was... pleasant. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though they were in the midst of a small city, it was like they were the only ones in the world right now, all alone together in this little house. Was it really alright for someone like her to experience such happiness? </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m so happy, Nadia.&quot; Willow whispered with a shy smile. &quot;I&#39;ve never felt this free before.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia made a small smile. &quot;I should be the one saying that,&quot; she mumbled. &quot;You&#39;ve allowed me to feel... all of this. Like I&#39;m human again.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow smiled, her eyes drooping. &quot;You&#39;ve always been human to me...&quot; she whispered, before drifting off to sleep. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia rubbed a few strands of her golden hair with a grateful smile and kissed her on the cheek. But once she pulled back, her expression dropped and she turned towards the window. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The cold breeze was blowing in, just like Willow preferred her nights to be, but Nadia felt an overwhelming sense of unease. She had been feeling it the whole day, in fact. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She reached into her satchel and pulled out a knife that would cause the least amount of spillage. She didn&#39;t want this place to be dirtied, not with Willow in the room. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You can come down from there now.&quot; Nadia called, her voice low and steady. It was a tone reserved for enemies, one she made certain Willow never heard.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For a moment, nothing happened, the sound of the wind pressing against her ears. But then, as if responding to her taunt, a figure dropped down from the awning above the window. The dark hood and mask obscured his face, but the glint in his slimy green eyes as he pulled the mask down betrayed his twisted nature.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, Nadia,&quot; the mysterious figure began, his grin sharp. &quot;I must say, you really pulled a fast one on me this time.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia&rsquo;s eyes narrowed, her grip tightening. &quot;Rino, leave this place,&quot; she hissed, raising her blade to let the moonlight catch its edge. &quot;Unless you want to end up in pieces.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rino chucked, his voice low and amused&mdash;a sound Nadia had always despised. &quot;You&#39;ve always had a way with such terrible words,&quot; he said. &ldquo;Tell me, why has the greatest assassin the Order ever trained abandoned her mission so easily? And staying with her target, no less?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia&rsquo;s jaw tightened, but she refused to step back. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a machine anymore,&quot; she admitted, her voice resolute. &quot;When I&#39;m with Willow, I feel human again.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rino laughed again. &quot;</span><span class="c3">Human?</span><span class="c0">&quot; he scoffed. &quot;You were never human, Nadia. You were a weapon I designed. But I suppose it doesn&#39;t matter anymore. Since you&rsquo;ve failed your mission, it falls to me to clean up your mess. This will be fun indeed.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He raised his own knives, their polished edges glinting menacingly in the moonlight. &ldquo;Two targets for the price of one,&rdquo; he continued, his grin widening beneath the mask he&rsquo;d pulled back over his face. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t kill you just yet. I&rsquo;ll make you watch your master die first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia hardened her stance, filling herself with readiness. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t beat me,&rdquo; she said, her tone sharp and full of untold grievances with Rino. &ldquo;You never have.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rino narrowed his eyes, his playful demeanor shifting into something far more dangerous. &quot;Shall we dance?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; Nadia snapped, rushing forward with full adrenaline propelling her. She had waited a long time for this moment, to finish off this bastard who seemed like a lingering thorn in her side. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rino was quick&mdash;quicker than she remembered&mdash;but he fought like a machine, trained to kill. Nadia, however, was no longer the assassin he had once trained. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As their knives clashed, Rino&rsquo;s grin remained, confident and taunting. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve grown weak, Nadia,&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;That little housemaid life of yours has dulled your edge. Now you&rsquo;re nothing but a reckless shell.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia&rsquo;s jaw tightened, her muscles straining with each parry. &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; she said, feinting to the side and swiping at his chest. However, he barely dodged&mdash;a thin red line bloomed across his ribs instead. &ldquo;But I have something you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Foolish, to feel so pointlessly confident, he mocked, lunging forward with deadly intent. &ldquo;What could you possibly have?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Something worth fighting for,&rdquo; Nadia snapped, her blades continuously clashing with his own. Just the force of their strikes was enough to cause sparks and create small dents in their weapons.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fight raged on, and despite Nadia&rsquo;s best efforts, the room was becoming a clear sign of their battle. Chairs were nicked, curtains were ripped, and blood was spilled from both sides. Both sides of Nadia were fighting against each other; her maid side admonished her for dirtying their room so recklessly, but her assassin side said that it was necessary to protect Willow.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In her conflicting mindset, Nadia began to strike harder, move faster, and breathe less. She wanted this fight to be over, to beat Rino before he beat her. But the frenzy came at a cost. Her muscles ached, her movements slowed, and her vision blurred at the edges. Yet Rino, too, was faltering. His attacks were growing sloppier, his confident grin slipping as frustration took its place.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Why are you so stubborn?&rdquo; he spat, his grin fading as frustration took hold. &ldquo;Have you forgotten the code? We took you in from the hellish slums and gave you everything&mdash;prestige, power, purpose! But instead, you chose to throw it all away for </span><span class="c3">her?</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia&rsquo;s eyes blazed. She could feel her hands bleeding through her gloves, but she barely noticed. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;d choose her again, every time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rino lunged at her with a roar. &ldquo;Hmph,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How utterly&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia sidestepped, her movements sharp and deliberate, and finally, she struck. Her knife found its mark, piercing through his neck with a visceral finality that echoed in the stillness that followed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Let him fall to the floor, Nadia simply stood there, observing the mess she had created. Silent tears began to fall from her eyes, and she couldn&#39;t bring herself to move. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A pair of warm arms encircled her from behind, pulling her into a gentle embrace. &ldquo;Nadia,&rdquo; Willow whispered, her voice soft yet steady. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Willow... you were supposed to be asleep...&quot; Nadia mumbled in surprise. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow rested her chin on Nadia&rsquo;s shoulder, her golden hair brushing against her cheek. &ldquo;Is that why you spiked my drink?&rdquo; she asked knowingly, a faint smile playing on her lips. &ldquo;So I wouldn&rsquo;t see any of this?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia turned away, shame etched into her features. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she muttered. &quot;I&#39;ve dirtied this place.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow shook her head, her hands reaching for Nadia&rsquo;s bloodied ones. &ldquo;No place is truly clean, Nadia,&rdquo; she said softly, wrapping the torn gloves with strips of cloth. &ldquo;And some dirt is part of life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Willow&hellip;&rdquo; Nadia looked to the ground, tears falling from her eyes. &ldquo;Willow&hellip; are you sure you want to love someone like me?&rdquo; She shook her head, unable to meet Willow&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;Look at what I&rsquo;ve done. I promised to leave this behind, to escape, and yet&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow turned her gently, placing a finger under Nadia&rsquo;s chin and lifting her face. Without hesitation, she pressed a soft kiss to Nadia&rsquo;s lips, silencing her words. &ldquo;You did what you had to,&rdquo; she whispered, shaking her head. &ldquo;And nothing you do will ever stop me from loving you, Nadia.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nadia looked into Willow&rsquo;s bright eyes, feeling the genuine affection and love her master felt for her. It was as though all the chaos and bloodshed faded away, leaving only the two of them in this moment. Her lips trembled into a tearful smile. &ldquo;I love you, Willow.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Willow&rsquo;s face turned a deep shade of red, her eyes wide with surprise at the direct confession. But then, her lips curved into a radiant smile, and she pulled Nadia into a tight hug. &ldquo;And here I thought you were too shy to say it,&rdquo; she mumbled, a shy grin softening her words. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In that small, bloodied room, amidst the wreckage of a battle, they held each other. And for the first time in what felt like forever, Nadia believed she was finally free.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr class="c8"><div><p class="c5"><a href="#ftnt_ref1" id="ftnt1">[1]</a><span class="c4">&nbsp;Coffee was introduced to the modern world in the late 15th century.</span></p></div></body></html>
