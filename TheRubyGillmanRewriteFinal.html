The air here was always thick with the scent of salt, a harsh, often terrible, smell that compounded with the awfully humid climate. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Oceanside was a perfectly ordinary town, with ordinary people, and today was a perfectly ordinary morning. But the Gillman family was far from ordinary. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our flexible heroine, Ruby Gillman, was, in many ways, a typical teenager&mdash;if, of course, krakens could ever be considered &ldquo;typical.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Quiet and unassuming, Ruby often kept to herself, yet beneath her reserved exterior was a deep, unwavering love for her family and a heartfelt appreciation for the small circle of friends she had managed to make.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby&rsquo;s mother, Agatha Gillman, was the family matriarch and a formidable figure in the real estate business. Agatha was the type who clung tightly to structure, rules, and discipline&mdash;principles she enforced rigorously, both at work and at home. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Her husband, Ruby&rsquo;s father, was a gentler soul by comparison, and their young son, Ruby&rsquo;s little brother, brought a playful energy to their otherwise secretive household.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">The Gillman family were krakens in every sense of the word, and it seems absurd to suggest that they could blend in with humans. But they did, in their own little way. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Over the years, the Gillmans had become experts in crafting plausible (if increasingly absurd) explanations for their unusual appearance. Sometimes they claimed ancestry from a distant country where blue skin was a genetic norm. Other times, they spoke of a rare hereditary skin condition. The creativity behind their excuses was matched only by their determination to avoid scrutiny.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">But the townsfolk were none the wiser. Perhaps they simply followed a rule of &ldquo;don&rsquo;t meddle in others&rsquo; business&rdquo;. Though, that doesn&rsquo;t stop the questions, or the stares, or worst of all, the misunderstandings.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruby lived her entire life hearing the same mantra: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go near the water.&rdquo; A truly inane statement for krakens to abide by, but this was a matter of secrecy. The easiest path to exposure is by water; any person knowledgeable on supernatural sea life knows this fact. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">But any person&mdash;or in this case, kraken&mdash;can feel the lure of the forbidden. Think back to your own childhood, to the times your parents told you not to touch something or go somewhere. Didn&rsquo;t the warning make it all the more tempting?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruby Gillman was no exception. And like any typical teenager, she wanted to be rebellious. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">But in all cases such as this, rebelliousness inevitably leads to change, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">This is the story of a kraken named Ruby Gillman, who lost friends, made friends, and stopped an entire war, all in the course of a few eventful days.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4 c9 c19" id="h.hipoex1hgfxu"><span class="c8 c10"></span></h2><p class="c16 c6"><span class="c12 c14 c13"></span></p><p class="c16 c6"><span class="c12 c14 c13"></span></p><p class="c6 c16"><span class="c12 c14 c13"></span></p><p class="c16 c6"><span class="c12 c13 c14"></span></p><p class="c16 c6"><span class="c12 c14 c13"></span></p><p class="c16 c6"><span class="c12 c14 c13"></span></p><p class="c16 c6"><span class="c12 c14 c13"></span></p><p class="c16 c6"><span class="c12 c14 c13"></span></p><h2 class="c4 c9 c19" id="h.s0ulp3ysj8q5"><span class="c8 c10"></span></h2><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4 c9" id="h.ns0yw36hwo32"><span class="c10">Chapter 2 - Un-Normal Morning</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c0">This story begins differently than most. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby Gillman didn&rsquo;t wake up late, frantically tossing off blankets or stumbling downstairs to catch breakfast. Nor did she wake in a cozy bed, the kind with soft sheets and fluffed pillows. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beds, she&rsquo;d long decided, weren&rsquo;t her thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Instead, Ruby stirred awake in a beanbag chair&mdash;a bright, slightly lopsided one that sat across from her neatly made bed. The faint hum of music played softly in her ears, her headphones still snug from the night before. Somewhere between groggy blinking and a lazy stretch of her arms, she realized the playlist she&rsquo;d fallen asleep to had looped its way into the early hours of morning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She flexed her fingers and let her rubbery joints pop softly, a sound that was oddly comforting to her. For Ruby, this was normal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While most people couldn&rsquo;t imagine sleeping anywhere but a bed, Ruby had always preferred something with a little give, something that matched her own self. Her body, after all, wasn&rsquo;t like most people&rsquo;s. A beanbag chair, with its shapeless embrace, suited her far better than the rigid confines of a mattress.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She unplugged her headphones, rolled out of the chair with a practiced ease, and began her morning routine. It wasn&rsquo;t hurried or chaotic, but rather rhythmic, shaped by years of trying to seem &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her clothes were already laid out&mdash;a habit she&rsquo;d picked up from her mother&mdash;and she slipped them on efficiently, despite the unavoidable challenge of her blue skin peeking out. No amount of fabric could hide that. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby paused in front of the mirror, taming her wild, rubbery curls into something resembling order. Even krakens, it seemed, had to deal with the universal nuisance of bed hair in the morning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the time she made it downstairs, the scent of breakfast lingered faintly in the air&mdash;toast, eggs, and that strange, smoky tang of whatever her dad had burned trying to &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; in the kitchen. Ruby smiled to herself. She loved mornings like this&mdash;mornings where her family felt grounded and real. She didn&rsquo;t know how &ldquo;normal&rdquo; krakens lived, but it didn&rsquo;t matter. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby was content.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; she called, which elicited equal responses.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruby sat down to eat at the table, noticing that her family members were engrossed in their own activities. </span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4 c9" id="h.61qe5d9a30sc"><span class="c8 c10">Chapter 3 - Hobbies</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Each member of the Gillman family had their own special hobbies. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruby loved music. While she wasn&rsquo;t a musician herself, she tried dabbling in the arts a few times. And other arts tickled her fancy too. She was an artsy teenager, like many teenagers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Human teenagers, not kraken teenagers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Humans have made some pretty weird things, but art is one of those creations that Ruby appreciates. In fact, she didn&rsquo;t know how regular krakens could function without a lot of human things. She grew up on the surface all her life, so this was all she knew.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">As she chewed on a piece of toast, Ruby&rsquo;s gaze shifted to her father, who was dusting off a shelf filled with intricate wood sculptures. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Her father had a passion for woodcrafting. What had started as a simple hobby had turned into something bigger&mdash;a full-blown creative outlet that he proudly shared with the world through his online blog. Over the years, he had built up a modest but loyal following, and his shelves were packed with miniature whales, towering ships, and delicate sea-themed carvings.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Across the room, Ruby&rsquo;s younger brother sat cross-legged on the couch, fully engrossed in a video game. He, too, had found his niche, albeit a digital one. If he wasn&rsquo;t gaming, he was scrolling through funny videos or chatting with friends online. Ruby wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure what he was watching most of the time, but his laughter was infectious enough that she didn&rsquo;t mind.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Then there was Ruby&rsquo;s mother, who was engrossed in reading listings for real estate properties. She often compared the work of others to herself, out of a sense of competitiveness. She was very serious about real estate. That, and her family, of course.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ruby, get ready for school,&rdquo; Agatha called out without glancing away from her screen. &ldquo;Time is of the essence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby rolled her eyes, finishing the last bite of her toast. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m already on it, Mom. Don&rsquo;t you all have things you&rsquo;re supposed to be doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Agatha raised an eyebrow but didn&rsquo;t look away from her laptop. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll </span><span class="c5">have</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;you know that what I&rsquo;m doing is </span><span class="c5 c11">very </span><span class="c0">important. This is reconnaissance work.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby let out a dramatic sigh, a small smile tugging at the corner of her mouth. &ldquo;Sure it is,&rdquo; she replied, shaking her head.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4 c9" id="h.jjuv2wovrkud"><span class="c8 c10">Chapter 4 - Oceanside</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby slung her backpack over her shoulders, the familiar weight settling against her back as she walked toward the door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Remember, don&rsquo;t go near the water!&rdquo; her mother&rsquo;s voice rang out from the kitchen, sharp and clear despite the clinking of plates and the hum of her laptop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know, Mom!&rdquo; Ruby called back, rolling her eyes as she opened the door. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever get tired of saying that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not as long as you keep walking past it every day!&rdquo; her mother retorted, her tone carrying a mix of worry and insistence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby stepped outside before the conversation could continue, letting the door swing shut behind her. The crisp morning air greeted her, and she adjusted the straps of her bag as she began her usual walk to school.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Oceanside was waking up around her, the town coming alive in its unhurried, coastal way. Ruby took in the familiar sights as she strolled down the sidewalks. The quaint buildings with weathered shingles and salt-streaked paint, the narrow streets lined with fishing nets and crates, the occasional cat perched on a porch railing&mdash;everything about Oceanside had a charm that felt timeless. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">But for all its charm, the irony of the Gillman family living in a town like this wasn&rsquo;t lost on Ruby. Oceanside was practically synonymous with water. The town sat perched on the coast, surrounded on nearly every side by the glistening expanse of the ocean.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">It wasn&rsquo;t just ironic&mdash;it was cruel. For a kraken like Ruby, being forbidden from going near the water felt like a punishment tailored specifically for her.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Oceanside wasn&rsquo;t without its peculiarities either. Ruby had grown used to the eccentric mix of people who lived here; you know, the usual townsfolk you&rsquo;d find in a coastal town. You have the paranoid ocean hunters, the often-busy fishermen, and the very private-to-themselves citizens. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Despite it all, Ruby loved Oceanside. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">It was cozy, small enough to feel familiar but large enough to offer moments of anonymity. The weather was perfect&mdash;warm, breezy, with just enough humidity to remind you that the ocean was always near. She couldn&rsquo;t imagine living anywhere else. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">And yet, every time Ruby walked to school, every time she passed by the boat docks, she felt like the town was teasing her.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruby knew something bad might happen if she went into the water, but she was curious. The thought of plunging her hand into the cool, briny depths was tantalizing. Just once, she thought. Just one touch.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruby shook her head, forcing her feet to keep moving. She wasn&rsquo;t about to test her parents&rsquo; warnings, no matter how tempting it was. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">But someday she was going to try. Someday. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">After all, what was the worst that could happen?</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4 c9" id="h.duzuvdhz2ts5"><span class="c8 c10">Chapter 5 - Friends</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c0">As Ruby entered the school building, she found her three friends waiting for her. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruby had become friends with these girls for a few years. She didn&rsquo;t know them too well, but they got along and had a few shared interests. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Margot was probably Ruby&rsquo;s closest friend. They had been friends for a little while longer than the others. She&rsquo;s often dramatic about a lot of things, overthinking situations and jumping to conclusions far too quickly. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Trevin was a reclusive girl who liked playing video games. Thanks to her brother, Ruby was able to somewhat connect with her using her limited video game knowledge. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Bliss was a gothic girl who liked dressing up in makeup and is often pessimistic. She&rsquo;s the most idealistic of the three. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruby appreciated her friends, because they brought a little sunshine into her locked-down life. However, as she approached them near the school lockers, they didn&rsquo;t look particularly happy at all.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey girls! How&#39;s it going?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The three girls glanced at each other. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ruby, we have to talk,&rdquo; Margot said, her face uncharacteristically hardened. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um&hellip; did something happen?&rdquo; Ruby asked nervously. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&ldquo;A </span><span class="c5 c11">lot</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of things happened,&rdquo; Bliss said, crossing her arms. Her sharp gaze cut straight through Ruby. &ldquo;And they all have to do with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby blinked, taking a step back as a sinking feeling settled in her stomach. &ldquo;...Me? But I haven&rsquo;t done anything!&rdquo; she protested, her voice rising defensively.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh? &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t done anything&rsquo;?&rdquo; Trevin scoffed, her usual quietness giving way to frustration. She crossed her arms tightly. &ldquo;What about all those lame excuses you&rsquo;ve been giving us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby&rsquo;s breath hitched. &ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo; she muttered, her cheeks flushing. It hit her now&mdash;what this was about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That was only a few times, though,&rdquo; she added with a nervous laugh, trying to downplay the situation. &ldquo;Haha&hellip; you know how it is...?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve turned us down </span><span class="c5 c11">every time,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Ruby!&rdquo; Margot snapped, her voice rising with exasperation. &ldquo;Every single time we&rsquo;ve invited you to do something, you&rsquo;ve blown us off with some half-baked excuse.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&ldquo;What? Haha, surely not </span><span class="c5 c11">every</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;time,&rdquo; Ruby stammered, though even as she said it, her mind replayed the countless moments her friends had asked her to hang out.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4 c9" id="h.s6ladsk04vh1"><span class="c8 c10">Chapter 6 - Endless Excuses</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c5">It really was </span><span class="c12 c5 c11">every single time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter the occasion, whenever Ruby&#39;s friends invited her to hang out, she always turned them down. Sometimes, she&rsquo;d stall for a moment, feigning interest, before delivering yet another carefully crafted excuse. Other times, her rejection was swift and almost rehearsed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, Ruby! We&rsquo;re going to a pool party this weekend. Want to join us?&rdquo; Margot had asked once, her tone brimming with excitement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby had hesitated for just a split second before replying, &ldquo;Oh, sorry. I&rsquo;m busy that weekend.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then there was Trevin&rsquo;s birthday the previous year.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ruby,&rdquo; Trevin had said, her voice quieter than usual, &ldquo;my birthday is this Friday&hellip; Would you be able to come?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby had smiled apologetically, clutching her schoolbooks a little tighter. &ldquo;Oh no, I&rsquo;m so sorry! My family&rsquo;s traveling that day. Maybe next year?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But next year came and went, and so did more excuses.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then there was the time Bliss had casually asked her about prom during lunch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ruby, do you think you&rsquo;ll go to prom? It&rsquo;s going to be on that big party boat at the marina,&rdquo; Bliss had said, trying to sound disinterested but clearly hoping for a yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby&rsquo;s response had been immediate, almost reflexive. &ldquo;No way. Sorry, I&hellip; I&rsquo;m terrified of boats!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The excuses weren&rsquo;t just occasional&mdash;they were constant. No event was safe from Ruby&rsquo;s evasion tactics. Birthday parties, movie nights, beach trips, school dances, even simple plans to grab ice cream after class&mdash;Ruby always found a way out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the worst part? Her friends had started noticing the pattern. They might not have said it aloud at first, but every &ldquo;sorry&rdquo; Ruby gave chipped away at their patience.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">It wasn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;a few times.&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;occasionally.&rdquo; It was every time. Every. Single. Time.</span></p><h2 class="c4 c9" id="h.dvcotuqn1mkn"><span class="c10">Chapter 7 - Friends?</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s every time, Ruby,&rdquo; Bliss said with a weary sigh, her arms crossed and her gaze fixed on the floor as if looking at Ruby was too difficult.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Ruby let out a nervous chuckle, glancing between the three girls. &ldquo;Oh, come on, it&rsquo;s not </span><span class="c5 c11">that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;serious&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&ldquo;You </span><span class="c5 c11">turned down prom,</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Ruby!&rdquo; Margot cut in, her voice rising with frustration. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just </span><span class="c5 c11">turn down prom!</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby instinctively shrank into herself, her shoulders hunching as she avoided their piercing stares. &ldquo;I&hellip; Like I said, I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Afraid of boats?&rdquo; Trevin finished sharply, her doubtful tone slicing through Ruby&rsquo;s excuse like a knife. Her arms were crossed tightly, her expression firm. &ldquo;You can keep coming up with excuses, Ruby, but it&rsquo;s not going to work this time. We&rsquo;ve heard it all before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby&rsquo;s lips parted, but the words didn&rsquo;t come. She stared down at the floor instead, her fingers nervously twisting the strap of her backpack. &ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Her voice was barely above a whisper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Margot exchanged a glance with Bliss and Trevin, who hesitated but ultimately gave reluctant nods. Turning back to Ruby, Margot&rsquo;s expression softened just a little, but her frown remained. She took a deep breath, her tone measured but heavy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, Ruby&hellip; we&rsquo;ve talked things over, and&hellip; we don&rsquo;t think we can be friends with you anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The words hit like a tidal wave. Ruby froze, her heart plummeting as if the ground had been pulled out from under her. For a moment, her mind raced to process what Margot had said. Then, desperate to deny it, she let out a strained laugh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? Haha, you guys are such jokers. Where&rsquo;s the punchline, huh?&rdquo; Ruby forced a smile, her voice trembling as her wide eyes searched their faces for even a glimmer of humor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But none of them laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no punchline,&rdquo; Bliss said bluntly, her voice colder than Ruby had ever heard it. She stared past Ruby, avoiding her gaze. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s over. You&rsquo;ve tossed us aside far too many times. We&rsquo;re tired of being your backup plan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true,&rdquo; Ruby stammered, shaking her head. &ldquo;I never meant to&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Trevin interjected, her arms still crossed. &ldquo;Then how do we know all those excuses weren&rsquo;t just so you could sneak off to meet some crush or whatever?&rdquo; Her tone was accusatory, but her eyes darted away, unable to meet Ruby&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Ruby&rsquo;s voice cracked. &ldquo;You guys, that&rsquo;s&hellip; that&rsquo;s crazy! I would never&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s crazy,&rdquo; Margot interrupted, her voice quivering with emotion, &ldquo;is that you call us friends, but school is the only place we ever see you. Do you even </span><span class="c5 c11">want</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to be our friend? Because it sure doesn&rsquo;t feel like it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby&rsquo;s breath hitched as Margot&rsquo;s words cut deeper than she thought possible. She opened her mouth to protest, to explain, but nothing came out. Her throat tightened, her chest ached, and her world felt like it was slipping further away with every passing second.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t really mean this,&rdquo; Ruby finally managed, her voice barely audible. Her wide, pleading eyes flicked between her friends, searching for a sign that this was all just a misunderstanding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Bliss was already motioning to the others. &ldquo;Come on, girls. We&rsquo;ve wasted enough of Ruby&rsquo;s time. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Trevin and Margot hesitated for a moment, glancing at Ruby one last time before following Bliss.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Girls&hellip; wait&hellip;&rdquo; Ruby&rsquo;s voice cracked again, the desperation in it painfully clear. But none of them stopped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they walked away, Ruby slumped against her locker, her entire world crashing down around her. Her heart felt as heavy as a sinking stone, and her usually bright, warm spirit now felt as cold and blue as her skin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Her friends&mdash;her </span><span class="c5 c11">only</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;friends&mdash;were gone. And the worst part? Deep down, Ruby couldn&rsquo;t entirely blame them.</span></p><h2 class="c4 c9" id="h.gtk3sdqy6f4g"><span class="c8 c10">Chapter 8 - Chelsea</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rejection is hard for everyone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But for Ruby Gillman, it wasn&rsquo;t just hard&mdash;it was suffocating. Despite her somewhat sociable nature, making friends had never come easily. She was different, undeniably so, and people didn&rsquo;t seem to know what to do with &ldquo;different.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Who would want to be friends with a girl who had blue skin?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby had learned to cherish the few friendships she&rsquo;d managed to build, but now that they were gone, ripped apart by all the misunderstandings, she felt utterly hollow. What was left? What was she, without them?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She sat alone at a secluded picnic table in the far corner of the schoolyard, picking at her meticulously prepared lunch. Normally, she relished these meals&mdash;crafted with care and always finished down to the last crumb. But today, the food sat untouched, a silent testament to her mood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault,&rdquo; Ruby muttered under her breath, poking half-heartedly at her sandwich. &ldquo;Why does everyone think it&rsquo;s my fault?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The words hung in the air, unanswered and heavy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lost in thought, she didn&rsquo;t notice the faint sound of approaching footsteps until they were practically upon her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe this school is so cozy! Oh&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A bright, excitable voice snapped Ruby out of her thoughts. She looked up to see a girl with fiery red hair standing at the edge of the clearing, her eyes locking onto Ruby&rsquo;s with unfiltered curiosity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry! I didn&rsquo;t realize anyone was here,&rdquo; the girl said, smiling. &ldquo;Are you eating lunch?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby frowned, turning away. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that what everyone else is doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fair point!&rdquo; the girl chirped, completely unfazed. &ldquo;Do you mind if I join you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby hesitated, the instinct to turn her away bubbling to the surface. But before she could find her voice, the girl had already plopped herself down across the table, beaming like they were old friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wow, your lunch looks so stylish!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um&hellip; thank you?&rdquo; Ruby replied, caught off guard by the comment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And your skin is so blue,&rdquo; the girl continued, leaning in with wide, curious eyes. &ldquo;Let me guess&mdash;some kind of rare family illness?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby blinked, her discomfort quickly morphing into annoyance. &ldquo;What? No, it&rsquo;s not&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;m Chelsea!&rdquo; the girl interrupted, clearly more interested in her own momentum than Ruby&rsquo;s explanation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m new here, but I guess you probably noticed me already?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby sighed, leaning back slightly. &ldquo;It was impossible not to. Your entrance was&hellip; hard to miss.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, good! I was hoping it made an impression!&rdquo; Chelsea clapped her hands together, genuinely pleased. &ldquo;And you are?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ruby Gillman,&rdquo; she muttered, reluctant to engage further. &ldquo;And actually&hellip; I&rsquo;d prefer it if you didn&rsquo;t sit here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea&rsquo;s smile faltered for a moment, but only for a moment. &ldquo;Ah. Is that why you&rsquo;re sitting alone?&rdquo; she asked, her tone suddenly softer. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ve been kind of rude, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before Ruby could answer, Chelsea stood up, her bright demeanor dimmed just enough to feel sincere. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going through something, you don&rsquo;t have to do it alone. I&rsquo;m here if you ever want to talk, okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby looked down at her uneaten lunch, unwilling to meet Chelsea&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; she mumbled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Great! See you around, Ruby!&rdquo; Chelsea chirped, her energy returning as she bounded off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once she was gone, Ruby let out a long sigh, her shoulders slumping. &ldquo;All that energy,&rdquo; she murmured, shaking her head. &ldquo;If I hang around her too much, she might actually be the death of me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But as she stared at the spot where Chelsea had stood, something tugged at the corner of her thoughts. Annoying as she was, there was something about Chelsea&rsquo;s brightness that was almost&hellip; infectious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Almost.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4 c9" id="h.4m2brb6hf9st"><span class="c10">Chapter 9 - Trepid Confessions</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruby grumbled as she sauntered out of the school building at the end of the day. Her mood was still terrible after her friends abandoned her, but meeting Chelsea during lunch just made things worse. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why does everything have to be so complicated?&rdquo; Ruby grumbled under her breath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As she walked toward the gates, her footsteps faltered. Up ahead, framed perfectly by the orange hues of the setting sun, stood Conner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Conner&hellip;&rdquo; she murmured, her voice barely audible as she stared at him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was effortlessly cool, standing by his bike, scrolling through his phone. His perfectly styled dreadlocks caught the light just right, and the easy way he carried himself made Ruby&rsquo;s stomach flutter. He was her crush&mdash;the boy she had admired from afar for what felt like forever.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, no matter how much she wanted to ask him to prom, she knew she couldn&rsquo;t. Even if he said yes (which was pretty much impossible), she wasn&rsquo;t allowed to go near water, let alone an event that might have a fountain or a decorative pool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But today, Ruby&rsquo;s mind was on overdrive. The ache of loneliness, the frustration bubbling inside her&mdash;it all collided into a single, reckless thought: What do I have to lose?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clutching the straps of her backpack, Ruby took a deep breath and started toward him, her shy expression betraying the storm of nerves inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, Ruby!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sudden voice made her jump. Chelsea appeared at her side, as energetic and oblivious as ever.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s got you all starry-eyed?&rdquo; Chelsea asked, grinning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby flinched, her face turning red. &ldquo;Hm? Oh, it&rsquo;s&hellip; um&hellip; nothing,&rdquo; she mumbled, trying to play it off. This was not what she needed right now. Not at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea wasn&rsquo;t buying it. She followed Ruby&rsquo;s gaze and spotted Conner. Her grin widened. &ldquo;Ohhh, I see. You&rsquo;ve got a crush on that guy over there, don&rsquo;t you? Conner, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby&rsquo;s face burned. &ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t have a crush&hellip;&rdquo; she stammered, her voice betraying her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to lie about it!&rdquo; Chelsea said, her voice far too loud for Ruby&rsquo;s liking. &ldquo;Go ahead and tell him!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Seriously, no, I&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before Ruby could stop her, Chelsea gave her a firm push forward. Ruby stumbled, barely catching herself before she collided with Conner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looked up, surprised but amused. &ldquo;Oh, that was&hellip; an interesting entrance,&rdquo; he said, tucking his phone into his pocket.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby froze, her mouth opening and closing as if searching for words. &ldquo;Um&hellip; sorry, I was just&hellip; er&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Conner prompted, tilting his head slightly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby&rsquo;s heart pounded in her chest. &ldquo;I just wanted to say&hellip; um&hellip; I&mdash;I like you&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before she could finish, Ruby&rsquo;s foot slipped on the edge of the sidewalk, and she instinctively reached out to steady herself. Unfortunately, her flailing arm caught Conner&rsquo;s shoulder, sending him stumbling backward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right into the nearby ocean.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The splash was deafening in the sudden quiet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; Ruby gasped, rushing to the edge. &ldquo;Conner!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She saw him struggling in the water, gasping and flailing. Her mind raced. She couldn&rsquo;t just stand there. But what would happen if she entered the water? Years of warnings flashed through her mind before she slapped her face with finality. She just didn&rsquo;t have a choice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without thinking, Ruby dropped her backpack and dove in after him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The cool water enveloped her instantly, and for a brief moment, the new sensation was comforting. This was the first time she had ever been in water, but her kraken instincts seemed to take over, as she swam toward Conner with swift, expert-level strokes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Conner, grab my hand!&rdquo; she called, reaching for him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He coughed and sputtered but managed to latch onto her arm. With a strength that surprised even herself, Ruby pulled him to the surface and toward the ocean&rsquo;s edge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; she said, pushing him up onto the embankment. Conner collapsed onto the grass, coughing but otherwise unharmed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby, however, didn&rsquo;t follow him out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As she tread water, a strange sensation rippled through her body&mdash;a tingling that started in her hands and spread outward. She looked down and saw her fingers elongating, becoming covered in suction cups she had never seen before. Her reflection in the water showed her skin glowing in the deep dark, her hair also floating unnaturally around her head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was transforming. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No&hellip; w-what is this?&rdquo; Ruby whispered, panic surging through her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ruby? Are you okay?&rdquo; Conner called, sitting up and looking back at the water.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby gasped, turning away. &ldquo;I&mdash;I have to go!&rdquo; she shouted, her voice trembling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before Conner could say anything else, Ruby dove underwater and swam as fast as she could. She didn&rsquo;t stop until she was far from the area, hidden beneath the waves.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4 c9" id="h.mf3xvib0fw3q"><span class="c8 c10">Chapter 10 - Growing Pains</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby found herself on the far side of the school grounds, her body still refusing to revert to normal. Her glowing golden eyes darted nervously to her elongated hands and shimmering blue skin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Come on&hellip; change back!&rdquo; she hissed under her breath, her voice trembling. She clenched her fists, willing the transformation to subside, but her body betrayed her. The panic inside her grew with every passing second.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why was this happening? What was triggering it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her frantic thoughts were interrupted by shouts echoing across the lake. Ruby&rsquo;s head snapped up, her glowing eyes locking onto the horrified faces of people on nearby piers and boats.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c5 c11">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a monster in the lake!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s huge!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Monster!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Each cry hit Ruby like a blow to the chest. Her heart pounded as she saw people pointing, some pulling out their phones to record the spectacle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No&hellip; no, I&rsquo;m not a monster!&rdquo; Ruby whispered, her voice breaking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But panic took over, and without thinking, she bolted toward the shore. In her mind, she was searching for a place to hide, but all she was doing was drawing more attention towards herself. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sprinting through the school grounds, Ruby ignored the gasps and screams of students as she barreled past them. Her claws scraped against walls, leaving deep gouges, and her glowing form left a trail of water on the pavement. Her mind was a storm of panic and confusion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She burst into the school library, ducking low to avoid hitting the doorframe. The quiet sanctuary was empty save for a few scattered students who froze in terror at the sight of her. Ruby darted between the shelves, crouching as much as her growing body would allow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Why is this happening?&rdquo; she whispered, her voice trembling. &ldquo;Mom&hellip; you didn&rsquo;t tell me this could happen. Are we&hellip; </span><span class="c5">are</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;we monsters?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her voice cracked as tears welled in her glowing eyes. She hugged herself, trying to shrink her form, but the transformation continued to spiral out of control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby&rsquo;s muscles tensed as another wave of change swept over her. Her body grew taller, her limbs elongating, and her shoulders broadened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh, ow!&rdquo; Ruby hissed as her head collided with the library ceiling. She looked up in alarm, realizing she could barely fit between the shelves anymore. &ldquo;No, no, no&hellip; please, stop!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ceiling groaned above her, cracks forming where her head had hit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c5 c11">Crack!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sound echoed through the library, followed by another.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c11 c12">CRACK! CRACK!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby&rsquo;s heart sank.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12 c5 c11">BOOM!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ceiling gave way with a deafening crash, sending debris and books tumbling around her as her body erupted through the structure. Shelves toppled like dominoes, and students screamed as they scrambled for cover.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby knelt in the rubble, her massive form trembling. &ldquo;Wait! I&rsquo;m not trying to hurt anyone!&rdquo; she cried, her voice booming and desperate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But no one was listening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Monster!&rdquo; someone shouted.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to destroy the school!&rdquo; another voice screamed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">The word </span><span class="c5 c11">monster</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;sliced through Ruby like a knife.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No! I&rsquo;m not&mdash;&rdquo; she tried to protest, but her towering form only reinforced their terror.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Overwhelmed, Ruby turned and bolted from the ruined library, her giant feet leaving deep indents in the concrete as she ran. She didn&rsquo;t know where she was going&mdash;she just needed to escape the </span><span class="c5">stares</span><span class="c0">, the shouts, and the crushing weight of being seen as a threat.</span></p><hr><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the other side of Oceanside, Agatha Gillman stepped out of a real estate office, a satisfied smile on her face after closing a property deal. But her contentment evaporated in an instant when she caught sight of a massive figure moving across the school campus in the distance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her eyes widened in shock, her breath catching in her throat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ruby&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered, dread filling her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without a moment to lose, Agatha raced to her car, her heels clicking frantically against the pavement. The stunned clients she had just signed with stared in bewilderment as she sped off, tires screeching.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please, Ruby,&rdquo; Agatha muttered under her breath as she navigated the winding roads. &ldquo;Hold on&hellip; I&rsquo;m coming.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She gripped the wheel tightly, her heart pounding as she prayed she wouldn&rsquo;t be too late.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4 c9" id="h.kevcps72janl"><span class="c10">Chapter 11 - Overdue Questions</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Agatha drove through Oceanside, her eyes scanning every street, alley, and corner for any sign of Ruby. Her knuckles were white as she gripped the steering wheel, her heart pounding in her chest. The sun dipped lower on the horizon, casting long shadows across the town, making her search feel even more desperate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Agatha spotted her. Ruby was perched on the edge of a dilapidated billboard along a quiet side road, her legs swinging idly as she stared out over the town. Her posture was slouched, and even from a distance, Agatha could feel the weight of her daughter&rsquo;s exhaustion and sadness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Agatha parked the car and hurried over, climbing the creaky metal ladder up to the billboard. As she reached the top, she carefully sat down next to Ruby, who didn&rsquo;t so much as glance her way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ruby,&rdquo; Agatha began softly, her voice tinged with worry. &ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby&rsquo;s gaze didn&rsquo;t waver from the horizon. &ldquo;What do you think, Mom?&rdquo; she muttered, her tone sharp but weary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Agatha hesitated, choosing her words carefully. &ldquo;I know this must feel overwhelming&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&ldquo;&lsquo;Overwhelming&rsquo;?!&rdquo; Ruby interrupted, her voice rising. She turned to face her mother, tears glistening in her eyes. &ldquo;I was terrified! I didn&rsquo;t even recognize myself. And everyone&mdash;</span><span class="c5 c11">everyone</span><span class="c0">&mdash;called me a monster.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Agatha placed a hand gently on Ruby&rsquo;s shoulder, but Ruby shrugged it off. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t a monster,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;None of us are. We&rsquo;re just&hellip; different.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby let out a bitter laugh, shaking her head. &ldquo;Oh, great. That&rsquo;s so much better. Because I&rsquo;m &lsquo;different,&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve lost everything&mdash;my friends, my chance at a normal life. Everything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Agatha frowned, her heart breaking at the sight of her daughter&rsquo;s anguish. &ldquo;If they were so quick to abandon you, Ruby, then&hellip; were they really your friends?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, they were!&rdquo; Ruby snapped, tears spilling over now. &ldquo;Of course they were. Or at least, I thought they were&hellip;&rdquo; Her voice cracked, and she wiped her face with the back of her sleeve, trying to hold herself together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, Ruby,&rdquo; Agatha said softly. She wanted to comfort her, to make it better, but the truth stood in the way. &ldquo;But if we&rsquo;re going to keep living here, we have to keep our true selves a secret. It&rsquo;s the only way to stay safe, even if it means&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;Even if it means ending friendships,&rdquo; Ruby finished bitterly. She looked down at her hands, clenching them into fists. &ldquo;Why, Mom? Why do we even live here if we have to lie about who we are? Why can&rsquo;t we just&hellip; be honest?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Agatha&rsquo;s expression darkened. She looked away, guilt flashing across her face. &ldquo;That&hellip; I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; she said, her voice barely above a whisper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. &ldquo;What do you mean you can&rsquo;t tell me? What else are you hiding from me? Does Dad know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Agatha hesitated, the words catching in her throat. &ldquo;Again&hellip; I can&rsquo;t tell you. But it&rsquo;s for your own good. If you knew&hellip; it would only make things harder.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby let out a hollow laugh, shaking her head in disbelief. &ldquo;Right. For my own good. I&rsquo;m so glad your secrets are more important than being honest with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before Agatha could respond, Ruby stood abruptly and climbed down the ladder. Agatha followed her down, but Ruby didn&rsquo;t stop until she reached the car, throwing herself into the backseat with a huff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Agatha slid into the driver&rsquo;s seat, stealing a glance at her daughter in the rearview mirror. Ruby stared out the window, her expression a storm of anger and sadness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you when the time is right, Ruby,&rdquo; Agatha said softly, but her words felt hollow even to herself.</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The drive home was silent, tension hanging thick in the air. As soon as they pulled into the driveway, Ruby stormed out of the car and into the house, slamming the door behind her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Agatha followed more slowly, her shoulders slumping with exhaustion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did something happen?&rdquo; a familiar voice asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Agatha looked up to see her husband standing in the doorway, concern etched on his face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She transformed,&rdquo; Agatha said quietly, pressing a hand to her forehead as if to steady herself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; he asked, his tone sharp. &ldquo;She transformed?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Agatha nodded, her voice trembling. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s asking questions, honey. More and more every day. She wants to know why we can&rsquo;t be honest, why we&rsquo;re even here. What should I do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He let out a heavy sigh, running a hand through his hair. &ldquo;We knew this day would come eventually. But&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re ready for her to know the truth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Agatha&rsquo;s gaze fell to the floor. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s ready, either. But she&rsquo;s not going to stop asking.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have to find a way to help her understand&hellip; without telling her everything. Not yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Agatha frowned but nodded. She rubbed her temples as she leaned against the kitchen counter, exhaustion written across her face. Her husband shifted uncomfortably, lingering by the doorway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is there something else?&rdquo; she asked, her tone sharp but tired.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her husband cleared his throat, avoiding her gaze. &ldquo;Well&hellip; uh&hellip; your brother&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Agatha froze, her hand dropping to her side. &ldquo;Brill?&rdquo; she hissed, spinning to face him. &ldquo;What do you mean </span><span class="c5 c11">Brill is here</span><span class="c0">? Where is he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In the living room.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without another word, Agatha stormed past him into the living room, where Brill Gillman stood with an air of casualness. He leaned against the back of the couch, his clothes pristine despite his long journey from the depths. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Agatha!&rdquo; Brill Gillman said with a wide, toothy grin, waving as if he were a beloved guest arriving for a family reunion. &ldquo;Long time, no see!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Agatha&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. &ldquo;Not long enough, apparently. What are you doing here, Brill?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He shrugged, his smile never faltering. &ldquo;Mother sent me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Agatha&rsquo;s jaw tightened. &ldquo;Of course she did.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Brill straightened up, suddenly looking more serious. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time, Agatha. Time for Ruby to come to the underwater kingdom. Mom says it&rsquo;s her coming of age, and she needs to&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Agatha interrupted, her voice firm. &ldquo;Absolutely not. I thought I made it clear to </span><span class="c5 c11">you</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and Mother that Ruby will never perform that godforsaken ceremony.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Brill scratched his head, looking genuinely confused. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s tradition. Every young kraken has to go through it. You did it, I did it&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&ldquo;And look how </span><span class="c5 c11">you</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;turned out,&rdquo; Agatha shot back, her tone dripping with frustration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Brill said, frowning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing just fine, thank you very much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Agatha rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Ruby isn&rsquo;t going,&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not ready for any of this&mdash;she doesn&rsquo;t even understand what&rsquo;s happening to her. And I will </span><span class="c5 c11">not</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;throw her into some ancient ritual just because Mother thinks it&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Brill held up his hands in mock surrender. &ldquo;Alright, alright. Don&rsquo;t shoot the messenger. I&rsquo;m just doing what Mom told me to do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">As they argued, Ruby sat on the stairs, listening intently. Her anger and frustration from earlier began to melt away, replaced by curiosity. </span><span class="c5 c11">The underwater kingdom? A coming-of-age ceremony?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;She thought back to her transformation earlier that day, the fear, the confusion&hellip; and the power.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She wanted answers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby leaned forward, trying to catch every word as her mother and uncle continued.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The underwater kingdom is our home, Agatha,&rdquo; Brill was saying. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s where Ruby belongs. You can&rsquo;t keep her from it forever.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t belong there,&rdquo; Agatha countered. &ldquo;She belongs here, with her family. Where she can live a normal life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Normal?&rdquo; Brill chuckled. &ldquo;Did you see what happened today? You really think she can live a </span><span class="c5 c11">normal</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;life up here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Agatha hesitated, her lips pressing into a thin line.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Brill shrugged and picked up his suitcase. &ldquo;Well, I said my piece. Mom&rsquo;ll be mad if I don&rsquo;t bring Ruby back, but hey, I tried.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He headed for the door, pausing to glance over his shoulder. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t hide her forever, Agatha. Sooner or later, she&rsquo;s gonna want to know the truth. After all, weren&rsquo;t you just like her once upon a time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Agatha didn&rsquo;t reply, her expression unreadable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby watched as Brill left the house, her mind racing. She waited a moment, then quietly slipped down the stairs and out the door, following him at a safe distance.</span></p><hr><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Brill stopped at the edge of the water, glancing around briefly before diving in with a wild, unpracticed leap.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby hesitated, staring at the rippling surface. Her instincts screamed at her to turn back, but curiosity overpowered her fear. She took a deep breath and dove into the water.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The moment she submerged, Ruby felt her body react instinctively. Her skin tingled as faint blue patterns glowed along her arms, and her legs shifted, giving way to the fluid, powerful movements of her true form. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unlike last time, this feeling felt&hellip; exhilarating. The lower she sank, the easier it became to accept the form she had taken. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She swam deeper, following the faint glow of Brill&rsquo;s trail. The water grew colder, darker, yet somehow more alive. Strange creatures swam past her, their forms glowing faintly in the deep. Coral structures loomed in the distance, and as she approached, she realized they weren&rsquo;t just reefs&mdash;they were towers, pillars that made up a sprawling underwater castle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The massive ocean mass stretched before her, a breathtaking world of bioluminescent spires and swirling schools of fish. Ruby&rsquo;s eyes widened as she took it all in, her heart racing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Brill turned, sensing her presence, and his expression shifted from surprise to amusement. &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he said, his voice carrying effortlessly through the water. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re as much of a rebel as Agatha once was. I didn&rsquo;t expect you to follow me, Ruby.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Ruby hesitated, her nerves threatening to take over. But she forced herself to speak. &ldquo;I want to know the truth,&rdquo; she said, her voice trembling but resolute. &ldquo;About all of this. About </span><span class="c5 c11">me.</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Brill smiled, his expression equal parts pride and mischief. &ldquo;Then welcome to the kingdom of the krakens,&rdquo; he said, gesturing to the glowing city behind him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all been expecting you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4 c9" id="h.5h8vda3cg0sc"><span class="c10">Chapter 12 - Super Powered Royalty</span></h2><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The Kraken Kingdom stood as a breathtaking testament to both power and beauty. Towering arches, adorned with intricate coral engravings, stretched high into the ocean&rsquo;s expanse, their elegant curves defying the weight of the sea. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Majestic towers and grand structures, hewn from carefully shaped sea rock, bore the marks of centuries of masterful craftsmanship&mdash;each stone a silent witness to the kingdom&rsquo;s enduring legacy.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">For Ruby, who had spent her entire life on land, the sight was nothing short of mesmerizing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Beautiful&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered in awe, as they entered a large castle made entirely of purple sea rock.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Brill said with a nod. &ldquo;But we probably shouldn&rsquo;t sightsee for too long&hellip; you don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s like when she&rsquo;s angry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Ruby asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your grandmother,&rdquo; Brill muttered, shifting uneasily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before Ruby could respond, a booming voice echoed through the grand hall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&ldquo;</span><span class="c5 c11">Brill!</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; the voice roared, shaking the very water around them. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re back already? Have you failed me once again?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby turned, her eyes widening as an enormous green kraken loomed into view. Her skin glistened like polished jade, and a crown of coral sat regally atop her head. Her presence was overwhelming, commanding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Grandmamah&hellip;&rdquo; Brill said, his tone a mix of fear and irritation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the towering figure&rsquo;s gaze wasn&rsquo;t on Brill&mdash;it was on Ruby. Her sharp eyes softened, filled with wonder and something else Ruby couldn&rsquo;t quite place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My goodness&hellip;&rdquo; she murmured, her voice quieter but no less powerful. &ldquo;My child&hellip; you&rsquo;re here at last.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby hesitated, her heart pounding. &ldquo;Are you&hellip; my grandmother?&rdquo; she asked, taking a tentative step forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In the rubbery flesh!&rdquo; the green kraken declared, spreading her arms wide. &ldquo;You may call me Grandmamah.&rdquo; Her tone turned brisk as she waved a tentacle at Brill. &ldquo;Leave us, Brill. I wish to speak with my granddaughter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; Brill began, frowning. &ldquo;Agatha said&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&ldquo;</span><span class="c5 c11">Did I not tell you to leave us?</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; Grandmamah snapped, her voice cutting like a blade through the water.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Brill held up his hands in surrender. &ldquo;Alright, alright! I&rsquo;m going!&rdquo; he grumbled, casting Ruby a sympathetic glance before retreating.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the room grew quiet, Grandmamah turned back to Ruby. Her expression softened again, though her commanding aura never faded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ruby, I imagine this is all very overwhelming for you,&rdquo; she said gently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby crossed her arms. &ldquo;Everyone keeps saying that,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;But Mom never even mentioned you. It&rsquo;s like you didn&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Grandmamah&rsquo;s eyes darkened, her voice dropping to a low murmur. &ldquo;Your mother&hellip; made her choice long ago. She turned her back on our family, on our duty.&rdquo; She straightened, gesturing for Ruby to follow. &ldquo;Come. Let us speak in a more fitting place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby hesitated but followed as Grandmamah led her into a grand chamber adorned with breathtaking murals. The walls told stories of battles and triumphs, of krakens reigning supreme over the ocean&rsquo;s depths.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is&hellip;&rdquo; Ruby trailed off, her eyes tracing the vibrant colors and intricate details of the artwork.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Our history,&rdquo; Grandmamah said, her voice reverent. &ldquo;You are descended from a long line of great kraken queens. Your transformation is proof of this legacy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby frowned, her gaze lingering on a mural of a colossal kraken battling a shadowy sea creature. &ldquo;So&hellip; I&rsquo;m a monster.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Grandmamah said firmly, her voice echoing with conviction. &ldquo;You are a protector. A hero. All female krakens possess the ability to transform, but yours is stronger because of your lineage.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby shook her head. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m just a teenager. I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are more than that,&rdquo; Grandmamah interrupted. &ldquo;You are the heir to the kraken royal line. This is your destiny, Ruby. Your responsibility.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby&rsquo;s eyes flicked back to the murals, her stomach twisting with doubt. &ldquo;What about these?&rdquo; she asked, gesturing to the images.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This art depicts our past,&rdquo; Grandmamah explained. &ldquo;For centuries, the seas have been a battleground. Many creatures sought to challenge our power, from the Umib&#333;zu to the Leviathans. But we krakens have always prevailed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Prevailed&hellip;&rdquo; Ruby repeated, her voice barely above a whisper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Grandmamah said, her tone swelling with pride. &ldquo;We are unmatched in strength, speed, and intelligence. Our kind possesses abilities no other creature can rival.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As if to prove her point, Grandmamah demonstrated, lifting a massive piece of coral with ease, firing a laser-like beam from her eyes to carve intricate shapes, and propelling herself through the water with astonishing speed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby watched in awe, her earlier doubts momentarily forgotten.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You must learn to harness your powers,&rdquo; Grandmamah said, her voice turning serious. &ldquo;The time will soon come when you will face our greatest adversaries.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby tilted her head. &ldquo;I thought you said we&rsquo;re the strongest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&ldquo;We were,&rdquo; Grandmamah admitted, her voice laced with bitterness. &ldquo;Until the mermaids emerged. Their queen, Nerissa, was once my closest friend. But she betrayed us&mdash;betrayed </span><span class="c5 c11">me.</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Betrayed?&rdquo; Ruby echoed, her brow furrowing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mermaids are cunning,&rdquo; Grandmamah continued, her expression hardening. &ldquo;Untrustworthy. If you ever encounter one, you must tread carefully. One misstep could tip the balance of the war.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;War?&rdquo; Ruby said, her voice rising. &ldquo;No one mentioned a war!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It has raged for decades,&rdquo; Grandmamah said. &ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s decision to abandon her duty left our side vulnerable. But I believe you can succeed where she failed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby shook her head, her mind spinning. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Grandmamah&rsquo;s expression softened, and she placed a gentle hand on Ruby&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to decide now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t delay for too long. Your crowning ceremony must take place soon. Until then, you must prepare.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby&rsquo;s gaze fell to her hands, her fingers curling into fists. &ldquo;But what if I can&rsquo;t do it? What if I&rsquo;m not who you think I am?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Grandmamah tilted her head, studying Ruby with an expression that was equal parts stern and compassionate. &ldquo;Do you think every queen before you was fearless? Do you think they never doubted themselves? Strength, my dear, is not the absence of fear&mdash;it is the courage to move forward despite it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby swallowed hard, her throat tight. &ldquo;I just&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m ready for all of this. I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out who I am.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then let us start with something simple.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Simple?&rdquo; Ruby asked, skeptical.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Grandmamah gestured with a tentacle, and the water around them shimmered. Suddenly, the room seemed to expand, and a series of underwater obstacles appeared&mdash;sharp coral mazes, whirlpools, and glowing targets that darted unpredictably through the water.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You will practice here,&rdquo; Grandmamah said. &ldquo;Your strength, your agility, your focus. You must learn to command the sea as it commands you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby stared at the training grounds, her stomach knotting. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know where to start&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then start where every great queen has started,&rdquo; Grandmamah said, her voice firm yet encouraging. &ldquo;By trying. Go on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Taking a deep breath, Ruby swam hesitantly toward the first obstacle&mdash;a narrow maze of jagged coral. She glanced back at Grandmamah, who gave her an expectant nod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Ruby muttered to herself, steeling her nerves. &ldquo;Here goes nothing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As she weaved through the maze, the sharp edges of the coral seemed to close in on her, but her body moved with surprising ease. She realized she could feel the currents, sense the water guiding her. Her tentacles, which had felt awkward and unwieldy on land, now moved with precision, almost instinctively.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the time she reached the end of the maze, she was breathing hard but grinning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Grandmamah clapped her tentacles together in approval. &ldquo;Well done, my child. You see? The ocean recognizes you as its own. You belong here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby hesitated, her smile faltering as a thought struck her. &ldquo;But what about my life up there? My goals, my family&hellip; What happens to all of that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Grandmamah&rsquo;s expression grew solemn. &ldquo;Being a ruler is deciding to forgo all sorts of relationships and dreams. Your mother had the same doubts, and made her decision. But for now, focus on mastering your powers. The time will come when you must decide where you truly belong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby nodded slowly, though the weight of those words settled heavily in her chest. Deep down, she couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling that everyone was still hiding something from her. </span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4 c9" id="h.2ta9t1y8im70"><span class="c8 c10">Chapter 13 - Chelsea, Again</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruby woke up early as always and prepared for school, though her thoughts were elsewhere. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Be careful, Ruby!&rdquo; her mother called from the kitchen as Ruby grabbed her bag and bolted out the door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uh-huh!&rdquo; Ruby shouted back absentmindedly, already halfway down the street.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At school, the day passed in a blur. She barely registered her teacher&rsquo;s lectures or her classmates&rsquo; chatter. Her mind was consumed with thoughts of the ocean, the power she had felt coursing through her veins, and the words her Grandmamah had spoken. By the time the final bell rang, Ruby was out of her seat before anyone else, sprinting toward her secret spot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The small outcrop of rocks near the water had become her sanctuary. Hidden from prying eyes, it was the one place she could safely experiment with her newfound kraken abilities. She kicked off her shoes, stripped down to her swimsuit, and dove into the cool embrace of the ocean.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once submerged, the transformation came effortlessly. Her skin glowed faintly, her tentacles extended, and her body moved with an agility that felt second nature. She practiced firing short bursts of laser vision at the rocks, though she was careful to avoid attracting attention. A couple of times, she misjudged her aim, cracking a rock clean in half. Another time, her super strength shattered a boulder into rubble.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it was the swimming that truly exhilarated her. Speeding through the water, she felt untouchable, like she belonged in the ocean more than she ever had on land. The sea wasn&rsquo;t just a place; it was a part of her, one she was slowly beginning to embrace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sun hung low in the sky when she finally emerged, shaking the water from her hair. Her exhilaration quickly evaporated when she spotted someone waiting for her on the shore.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other girl leaned casually against a rock, her arms crossed and a sly grin playing on her lips.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; Chelsea said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a special one, aren&rsquo;t you, Ruby?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby froze, her glowing skin dimming slightly as she instinctively tried to shrink into the water. &ldquo;Chelsea! This is&hellip; um&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;An illness? Is that what you&rsquo;ve been telling people?&rdquo; Chelsea raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not just a terrible liar&mdash;you&rsquo;re an obvious one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t doing anything!&rdquo; Ruby stammered, ducking lower into the water to hide the full extent of her transformed body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea&rsquo;s gaze flicked to the faint glow beneath the surface, and her grin widened. &ldquo;Sure. You&rsquo;re just swimming. Funny, though&hellip; I went through a lot of trouble investigating after that &lsquo;monster incident&rsquo; at school. And you know what? That monster looked an awful lot like you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Coincidence,&rdquo; Ruby said quickly, her voice cracking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea laughed, the sound sharp and cutting. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re full of excuses, Ruby. But didn&rsquo;t you ever wonder why the fishermen didn&rsquo;t catch you that day? I distracted them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;You&hellip; what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;ve known about you for a while,&rdquo; Chelsea said, taking a step closer to the water. &ldquo;So stop lying to me. I know exactly what you are.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Without warning, Chelsea jumped in after Ruby, taking her by the hand and pulling her deeper into the water.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The transformation overtook Ruby instantly, her body shifting into her kraken form despite her efforts to resist. But as the water surrounded them, Ruby noticed something strange. Chelsea was changing too.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">But Chelsea wasn&rsquo;t a kraken. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">She was a mermaid.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4 c9" id="h.o1lfwekcuby"><span class="c8 c10">Chapter 14 - Aquatic Connection</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Ruby stammered, pointing a trembling finger at Chelsea as her grandmother&rsquo;s words echoed in her mind. &ldquo;Mermaid!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby instinctively kicked her powerful legs, trying to swim away, but Chelsea darted forward with ease, a playful laugh bubbling from her lips.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you scared of me?&rdquo; Chelsea teased, tilting her head in mock curiosity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re evil! I know it!&rdquo; Ruby shouted, her voice trembling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea grinned and suddenly swept Ruby into her arms, holding her bridal-style with an infuriating ease.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Oooh, I&rsquo;m </span><span class="c5 c11">soooo</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;evil!&rdquo; Chelsea said, her voice dripping with amusement as she spun them in the water.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stop it! Let me go!&rdquo; Ruby squirmed, but Chelsea&rsquo;s grip was steady.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Relax, dummy,&rdquo; Chelsea laughed, her voice softening. &ldquo;If I wanted to hurt you, don&rsquo;t you think I would&rsquo;ve done it already?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby flinched as Chelsea&rsquo;s hand brushed against her glowing, flexible skin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; Chelsea murmured, her tone quieter now, &ldquo;your skin looks beautiful underwater. It almost looks alive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby felt her cheeks grow warm, a blush spreading despite the cool water surrounding them. She turned her face away. &ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re trying to do, but whatever it is, it&rsquo;s not going to work!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to do anything,&rdquo; Chelsea replied, her voice carrying an unexpected gentleness. &ldquo;If anything, </span><span class="c5 c11">you&rsquo;re</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the one doing a lot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby hesitated, her mind racing. &ldquo;Grandmamah told me all about mermaids. She said you&rsquo;re untrustworthy&hellip; that you brought about the Oceanos War.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea&rsquo;s playful expression faltered, her brightness dimming for the first time. &ldquo;Is that what they say?&rdquo; she asked softly. &ldquo;It seems the war has left both of our kinds full of... misconceptions. My mother always told me that krakens were greedy, power-hungry creatures who wanted to rule everything they touched.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true!&rdquo; Ruby shot back, her voice catching. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never wanted anything like that. All I&rsquo;ve ever wanted is&hellip; to have friends. And maybe just&hellip; live a normal life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Chelsea&rsquo;s gaze softened, and a small, wistful smile curved her lips. &ldquo;Then I guess we&rsquo;re both pretty misled, huh? It&rsquo;s hard being seen as the &lsquo;evil&rsquo; one or a &lsquo;warmonger&rsquo; when you&rsquo;ve never even </span><span class="c5 c11">seen</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the war. Life&rsquo;s so much simpler on land. Up there, no one knows me as a mermaid. I&rsquo;m just&hellip; the popular girl. Chelsea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby blinked, the Chelsea she knew at school suddenly feeling like a stranger. &ldquo;You&hellip; you&rsquo;re not at all who I thought you were. At school, you&rsquo;re so&hellip; bright and confident all the time. I thought that&rsquo;s who you really were.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea let out a soft, humorless laugh. &ldquo;Far from it,&rdquo; she admitted, her voice quieter now. &ldquo;I use that persona to&hellip; well, to blend in. It&rsquo;s easier to pretend your troubles don&rsquo;t exist when you&rsquo;re everyone&rsquo;s &lsquo;bright, optimistic&rsquo; friend. No one asks questions that way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby&rsquo;s heart ached at the vulnerability in Chelsea&rsquo;s voice, so different from the girl she thought she knew. &ldquo;I&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been so unfair to you. I didn&rsquo;t realize&hellip; we&rsquo;re more alike than I thought. In more ways than one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea&rsquo;s smile returned, brighter this time but still gentle. &ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t we take the time to actually get to know each other? I&rsquo;m new here, Ruby. I don&rsquo;t have any real friends yet. You could be my first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby hesitated, doubt flickering in her chest. &ldquo;But&hellip; would it even be okay? To make friends with someone who&rsquo;s&hellip; well, from an opposing species?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea chuckled, her eyes sparkling with mischief as she gave Ruby a playful grin. &ldquo;Ruby, since when have rules ever stopped teenagers like us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before Ruby could reply, Chelsea shot upward, breaking through the water&rsquo;s surface in a burst of speed, Ruby firmly in her arms. The abruptness of it all left Ruby sputtering as they floated above the waves. She glared at Chelsea, her glowing eyes narrowing. &ldquo;A little warning would&rsquo;ve been nice!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea only shrugged, a cheeky smirk playing on her lips. &ldquo;Oops,&rdquo; she said, not sounding the least bit apologetic. Then her gaze softened, her tone shifting as she asked, &ldquo;So, Ruby, are we friends?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The question hung in the air between them. Ruby hesitated, her hands curling into glowing fists at her sides as she tried to process Chelsea&rsquo;s words. Friends? The word felt heavy, unfamiliar. This wasn&rsquo;t how it was supposed to be. Mermaids were supposed to be the enemy, dangerous and untrustworthy. That&rsquo;s what Grandmamah had always warned her. But here was Chelsea, her defenses down, offering a kind of warmth Ruby had rarely felt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Friends&hellip;&rdquo; Ruby echoed softly, the word seeming foreign on her tongue. Her glowing fists trembled as she glanced away. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I can trust you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea nodded, her smirk softening into something more thoughtful. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair. Trust takes time, doesn&rsquo;t it? But here&rsquo;s the thing: I&rsquo;m not going anywhere, and neither are you. We&rsquo;ve got time to figure it out.&rdquo; Her grin returned, this time tinged with mischief. &ldquo;Besides, you&rsquo;re kind of stuck with me now. You&rsquo;ve got to keep my secret, and I&rsquo;ve got to keep yours. It&rsquo;s like... an unspoken pact.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby glanced down at her distorted reflection in the water, the shimmering surface rippling around her glowing, otherworldly skin. She had spent so long hiding, so long feeling like an outsider. The thought of having someone who understood&mdash;even a little&mdash;was dangerously tempting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I guess&hellip;&rdquo; Ruby said slowly, her voice cautious, &ldquo;I could give it a shot. But don&rsquo;t think this makes us real friends. Not yet. You&rsquo;ll have to prove yourself first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea&rsquo;s grin widened, her eyes dancing with playful determination. &ldquo;Challenge accepted. I&rsquo;ll be the best fake friend you&rsquo;ve ever had.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby rolled her eyes, but despite herself, a small smile crept onto her lips. Chelsea&rsquo;s infectious energy was hard to resist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea drifted closer, her grin softening as her gaze turned earnest. The water rippled gently around them. &ldquo;You know, Ruby, you&rsquo;re a lot cooler than you give yourself credit for. All these powers, this whole kraken thing&mdash;it&rsquo;s pretty amazing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby&rsquo;s smile faltered, her glowing features shadowed by doubt. &ldquo;Amazing? It doesn&rsquo;t feel that way. Most days, it&rsquo;s just... a curse. Everyone&rsquo;s scared of me. Even I&rsquo;m scared of me sometimes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea tilted her head, studying Ruby with a mix of empathy and determination. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re looking at it wrong. Yeah, being a mermaid isn&rsquo;t all sunshine and rainbows&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been hiding who I am my whole life. But it&rsquo;s also... freeing. We can do things no one else can, Ruby. We can be something more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby searched Chelsea&rsquo;s face, looking for any hint of deception. But there was none&mdash;only a sincerity that made her chest ache. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before she could respond, a loud splash echoed across the water. Both girls froze, their heads snapping toward the noise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Ruby whispered, her voice tight with unease.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea&rsquo;s smile vanished, replaced by a sharp, alert expression. &ldquo;Trouble,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to go. Now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No time to argue!&rdquo; Chelsea grabbed Ruby&rsquo;s hand, pulling her along the water&rsquo;s surface with surprising urgency.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A low, rumbling motor cut through the stillness, growing louder by the second. An old, weathered fishing boat sped toward them, its rusty hull slicing through the waves. At the helm stood a grizzled man with wild, determined eyes: Gordon, the infamous cryptid catcher.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I knew I spotted somethin&rsquo; out here!&rdquo; Gordon bellowed, his voice carrying over the crashing waves. &ldquo;Two creatures this time! I&rsquo;ve hit the jackpot!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby&rsquo;s heart sank. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Gordon,&rdquo; she whispered to Chelsea, panic creeping into her voice. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s obsessed with proving that sea monsters exist.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea let out a dry laugh, glancing over her shoulder at the rapidly approaching boat. &ldquo;Well, at least someone in this town has some sense.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Chelsea, this isn&rsquo;t funny!&rdquo; Ruby hissed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Chelsea&rsquo;s smirk returned, undeterred by the danger. &ldquo;Relax, Ruby. We&rsquo;ve got this. Follow my lead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What followed was a chaotic chase across the open water. Gordon shouted threats from his boat, steering it with reckless determination as Chelsea and Ruby weaved through the waves, diving and resurfacing in an effort to throw him off. The adrenaline coursing through Ruby&rsquo;s veins was both terrifying and exhilarating.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At last, the girls managed to lose Gordon, slipping into the shadowy embrace of a hidden cove. Breathless and soaked, they floated side by side, the tension giving way to a burst of laughter. Ruby couldn&rsquo;t help herself&mdash;she laughed harder than she had in years, the sound light and unrestrained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea grinned at her, clearly pleased. &ldquo;See? I told you we&rsquo;d make it. You&rsquo;ve got to admit, that was kind of fun.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruby shook her head, still laughing. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re insane.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Chelsea said with a shrug, her grin never wavering. She floated closer, her expression softening. &ldquo;So, Ruby, what do you say? Friends?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby hesitated, but as she looked at Chelsea&mdash;at her genuine smile, her bright eyes, her unwavering confidence&mdash;she realized had never met anyone who possibly understood her troubles more than Chelsea did. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Ruby said finally, her voice quiet but steady. &ldquo;We can be friends.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea&rsquo;s grin widened. &ldquo;Told you I&rsquo;d win you over.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ruby rolled her eyes, but her smile remained. &ldquo;Something tells me I&rsquo;m going to regret this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4 c9" id="h.h90d88f4up6x"><span class="c8 c10">Chapter 15 - Dreams of Peace</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruby and Chelsea sat in a small restaurant after school, sharing dessert. For the past few days, their friendship had developed into something far closer than any relationship Ruby had ever had.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Despite her extroverted personality, Chelsea shared many of the same feelings with Ruby, feelings of insecurity, loneliness, and ostracization. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Chelsea bit into a piece of cake, her eyes closing as she took in the flavor. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This dessert is so amazing,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;Humans really are masters of their craft, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hm, I&rsquo;ve never thought of it like that. But you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Ruby responded.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I mean, how do they make something taste so good? I can&rsquo;t even begin to imagine the thought process.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I could teach you sometime.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh? You know how to make this&hellip; what was it called&hellip; this cake?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, my mom has a lot of events for work. She always asks me to help with baking desserts.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well now you&rsquo;ve got to teach me!&rdquo; Chelsea exclaimed. &ldquo;You know so many interesting things, Ruby.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not all that great&hellip;&rdquo; Ruby muttered with a sheepish smile. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Take pride in yourself, Ruby!&rdquo; Chelsea exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kraken royalty. You have nothing to be ashamed about. In fact, I&rsquo;m impressed that you know so much about human matters.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruby looked down at the surface of the table and took a bite of the cake herself. &ldquo;Mm&hellip;&rdquo; she nodded. &ldquo;Chelsea, you&rsquo;re from the ocean, right? I was born on land, so I practically have to stay here, but why are you here, exactly? Why would a mermaid want to live with humans?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well&hellip; I wanted to escape. I hated being shackled by the war and wanted a freer life. But I&rsquo;m also looking for someone who can help me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Help you with what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ending the war. None of the underwater kingdoms have been of use. This was the only option I had. But now that I&rsquo;ve found you, perhaps you were who I was searching for.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruby turned away with a flush. &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. You&rsquo;re a kraken who is powerful enough for the deadly task I require.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And what is this task?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this tool I&rsquo;ve heard about from stories, called the Trident of Tears. They say it has the power to bring peace just with its presence. If I can claim it and bring it to the battlefront, then maybe the war will end.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But why would you need someone like me for that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because the trident is hard to reach. But with your kraken powers, maybe you can in my stead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruby took her words and nodded. &ldquo;How hard is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Extremely. The trident is protected by three cyclones. Each one is more violent than the one preceding it. I&rsquo;ve nearly died trying to reach it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where is this trident?&rdquo; Ruby asked after a pause.</span></p><hr><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s right there,&rdquo; Chelsea said, pointing toward a massive underwater opening. Beyond it, swirling cyclones churned violently, twisting the water into treacherous currents.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Ruby narrowed her eyes, studying the chaotic whirlpools. She could feel the energy radiating from them, wild and untamed. Her determination flared.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let me try,&rdquo; she said, shifting forward.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Chelsea&rsquo;s eyes widened in alarm. &ldquo;Wait, you&rsquo;re not&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">But Ruby was already surging ahead, ignoring the warning. She dove straight into the first cyclone without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, her instincts guiding her forward.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The moment she hit the current, it was like being caught in the grip of a raging storm. The water yanked her back and forth, twisting her helplessly through the merciless torrent. She barely had time to register the sharp sting of the pressure before it spat her out with violent force.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Ruby tumbled through the water, disoriented and aching. Cuts lined her arms and legs from the sheer intensity of the cyclone&rsquo;s pull. She groaned as she steadied herself, the pain settling in.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ow&hellip;&rdquo; she muttered, wincing.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ruby!&rdquo; Chelsea was already at her side, worry etched across her face. She placed firm hands on Ruby&rsquo;s shoulders, scanning her injuries. &ldquo;I told you! You&rsquo;re not ready yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Ruby clenched her fists, frustration bubbling up. She hated feeling powerless. But looking at Chelsea&mdash;at the concern in her eyes&mdash;she sighed, allowing the tension in her shoulders to ease.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; she admitted with a small frown. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll practice first.&rdquo;</span></p><hr><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">The next morning, as Ruby grabbed her backpack and headed for the door, her mother&rsquo;s voice stopped her in her tracks.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ruby.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">She turned to see her mother standing in the kitchen doorway, arms crossed, her expression laced with concern.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where have you been going after school lately?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Ruby hesitated for only a second before offering a casual shrug. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been hanging out with my new friend.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Her mother&rsquo;s gaze sharpened. &ldquo;Chelsea?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Ruby nodded, adjusting the strap of her bag.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Her mother sighed, pressing her lips into a thin line. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something&hellip; off about that girl. I can&rsquo;t explain it, but I have a bad feeling. You need to be cautious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Ruby let out a groan, rolling her eyes. &ldquo;Mom, it&rsquo;s fine! You&rsquo;re seriously overreacting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Without waiting for a response, she pushed open the door and stepped outside, the crisp morning air hitting her face.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Behind her, her mother remained in the doorway, her frown deepening as she watched Ruby disappear down the street. Something about this didn&rsquo;t sit right with her. Not at all.</span></p><hr><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">After practicing in the kraken kingdom after school, Ruby turned to Grandmamah out of curiosity. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Grandmamah&hellip; have you heard of the &lsquo;Trident of Tears&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Grandmamah froze. &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I said&hellip; have you heard of the&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Trident of Tears? That infernal device was a weapon used by the mermaids during the war.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Weapon? I thought it was an object of peace?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is. But it is also not at the same time. Why are you asking?&rdquo; Grandmamah turned to Ruby with a suspicious glare.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. I just&hellip; heard about it and was curious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good. Don&rsquo;t go looking for it. Bad omens are sure to follow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruby nodded, though she knew she wasn&rsquo;t going to listen whatsoever.</span></p><hr><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Each passing day, Ruby got better at using her powers. She used them to keep trying for the trident. With each attempt, she was growing closer and closer to the end of the maelstrom. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">But at the same time, she was also getting more and more injured.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That felt like it was so close,&rdquo; Ruby sighed, wincing as Chelsea applied bandages to her arms for the sixth time. They sat on a nearby dock, away from prying eyes.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to rush, Ruby,&rdquo; Chelsea said, frowning. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like seeing you injured like this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; Ruby exclaimed, pumped full of adrenaline. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say this was for your dream?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My dream&hellip;&rdquo; Chelsea turned away, frowning. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s a small price to pay&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruby nodded. &ldquo;I think if I practice one more time, I&rsquo;ll breach the third cyclone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. For peace, I&rsquo;m certainly going to keep trying this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruby stood up. &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;m going to the kingdom. See you tomorrow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Chelsea nodded. &ldquo;Yeah&hellip; see you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruby smiled and jumped into the water. Chelsea watched for a while, even after she was already gone. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I can do this,&rdquo; she muttered sadly. </span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4 c9" id="h.8gvfkdnx4kcx"><span class="c8 c10">Chapter 16 - Trident Prongs</span></h2><p class="c16"><span class="c0">Ruby and Chelsea stood at the edge of the cyclones for what they hoped was the final time. </span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; Chelsea asked nervously. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready. This time, I&rsquo;ll reach it.&rdquo; Ruby said confidently. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Chelsea made a distant expression. &ldquo;Good luck,&rdquo; she said. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Ruby said with a smile. She hugged Chelsea for good luck and then with her confidence higher than ever, she jumped into the maelstrom.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; Chelsea whispered.</span></p><hr><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The trident&rsquo;s crypt was as dangerous as described. Ruby had become used to its dangers, but even then she still couldn&#39;t fathom how anyone created such a terrible place.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">She could still feel the remnants of injuries sustained through their many attempts at reaching the bottom.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">But she had to keep trying, if not for her new best friend, for her own self-satisfaction. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Peace was at the end, wasn&rsquo;t that a worthwhile goal?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruby sped downwards, wincing as she broke through the first cyclone and crashed into the second. Her body was thrashed around, leaving her with unavoidable injuries in the process. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Squinting, Ruby rolled and bent her flexible body to avoid the powerful mini cyclones. With a violent thrash, she flew through the second layer. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The third layer contained a single cyclone, but the opening was extremely narrow, requiring precise positioning. Ruby tried all sorts of things to get through, failing each time.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Exhausted and her patience wearing thin, Ruby threw one of her arms and used it like an elastic rubber band, slinging herself towards the middle of the final cyclone.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">With a loud </span><span class="c10">splurch</span><span class="c0">, which Ruby presumed to be the sound of her skin splitting open somewhere, she tumbled into the end, where she had never been before.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ruby tried to stand and winced. &ldquo;Ouch&hellip;&rdquo; she hissed, feeling blood dripping down her arms. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Limping forward, her entire body ached with fatigue. But Ruby smiled tiredly, feeling accomplished.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ahead of her, a majestic trident made of delicate sea crystal stood on a pedestal. Its surface was worn from years of being in a damp environment, yet Ruby could feel the power that emanated from it. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">She slowly approached, her exhaustion momentarily forgotten in the face of her awe.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">She swam towards the trident briskly. Taking a deep breath, she admired it up close and marveled.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So beautiful&hellip;&rdquo; she muttered aloud. Without thinking, she reached out and grasped the smooth hilt.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Ruby was hit with a blast of split second visions of the past. She saw krakens and mermaids forging the trident together, she saw krakens using it for evil, then she saw mermaids using it for evil, and then she saw a younger mermaid holding the trident with tears in her eyes, seemingly placing it in the very place where Ruby stood.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Returning to her senses, Ruby blinked in surprise. &ldquo;Weird&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">She shook her head and slowly lifted the trident from the crevice it sat in. At that moment, she then heard a rumbling sound that grew louder and louder as she looked around.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Suddenly, a giant wave washed over Ruby, sending her flying upwards through the cyclones. &ldquo;Waah! No one told me about this!&rdquo; She cried, flying through all three layers within seconds.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Then as soon as it began, it was over. Ruby found herself back atop the crypt entrance, the trident in her hand. Looking at it, she saw it glowing a soft blue. </span><span class="c5 c11">Such a pretty color</span><span class="c0">, she thought.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ruby!&rdquo; Chelsea exclaimed, running over to her. &ldquo;Oh, your arm&hellip;&rdquo; Chelsea ran her hands along the massive injury Ruby sustained, causing her to wince.</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.meye7hrvn0s8"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Who cares about that?&rdquo; Ruby said with a cheeky smile. </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;We did it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.xz5iixhcgw1k"><span class="c0">She hugs Chelsea and spun her around several times.</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.8blaao6b08pb"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s&hellip;the trident?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.sho0nxwmidt4"><span class="c0">Chelsea slowly asked, her eyes locked onto the mystical object.</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.wt6z97anqjrj"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yep, here it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.p86smeqtl7n6"><span class="c0">Ruby held it out to her in a way that made Chelsea frown and twitch. </span></p><p class="c4" id="h.ntwtf8ko7xp5"><span class="c0">&ldquo;After all this time&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.iv0r3v3lgasw"><span class="c0">She was hesitant, but she reached out to touch it, her fingers slowly grasping the crystalline surface. She can feel the power. Her face went blank.</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.c3z98cqslrvw"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Chelsea? You&rsquo;ve gone awfully quiet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.b2qfmbqj4z"><span class="c0">Chelsea&rsquo;s grip on the trident tightened. She looked up at Ruby with a distant grimace.</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.4vukzwok7hjq"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry, Ruby,&rdquo; she muttered.</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.ho2dhs7b33ve"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.x364yxd5k61w"><span class="c0">Ruby had no time to react as Chelsea ripped the trident from her hands and sent her flying with a blast of powerful magic. </span></p><p class="c4" id="h.6jl9j3sirusl"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh&hellip; Chelsea? What are you doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.y1jmrp63ts1l"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your grandmother was right, Ruby.

A kraken would never understand&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.yopw55tynu9v"><span class="c0">Chelsea blasted the rocks around Ruby, trapping her under debris.</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.cc7jrbnpwsqo"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This isn&#39;t about coexistence. This is about survival. Please don&rsquo;t try to stop me. I really don&rsquo;t want to fight you, Ruby.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.bs5x8y249np7"><span class="c0">With one last look of regret, Chelsea swam away leaving Ruby looking devastated.</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.bs5x8y249np7-1"><span class="c5 c11">Chelsea&hellip;</span></p><h2 class="c4 c9" id="h.kurlqioduiw5"><span class="c8 c10">Chapter 17 - About Chelsea</span></h2><p class="c2" id="h.z1bi6nnze6r2"><span class="c0">Let&rsquo;s take a moment to talk about Chelsea. Compared to krakens, mermaids are very free spirited creatures. </span></p><p class="c2" id="h.z1bi6nnze6r2-2"><span class="c0">In fact, the very idea of war was antithetical to their original core values. But it seemed that those values were forgotten over the years. </span></p><p class="c2" id="h.z1bi6nnze6r2-3"><span class="c0">And those who suffer most from war are those who aren&rsquo;t even involved. </span></p><p class="c2" id="h.z1bi6nnze6r2-4"><span class="c0">When Chelsea was a young mermaid, she experienced the worst thing any young child can experience. Her parents were an unfortunate casualty of the neverending war.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.z1bi6nnze6r2-5"><span class="c0">The sea had been red that day, a deep, unnatural red that stretched far into the depths. It carried the stench of something unspeakable, something that made her struggle to breathe. Her small body trembled as she swam through it, her vision blurred by never-ending tears. The full reality of what happened refused to settle in her mind, too awful to comprehend.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.z1bi6nnze6r2-6"><span class="c0">She could only swim, lost in a haze of sorrow and fear, until she no longer recognized the waters around her.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.z1bi6nnze6r2-7"><span class="c0">For what felt like an eternity, she drifted, alone and aimless. Time lost all meaning. How long had she been wandering? Days? Weeks? She didn&rsquo;t know, and no one came to find her&mdash;until, suddenly, someone did.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.z1bi6nnze6r2-8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You poor child&hellip; you&rsquo;ve lost everything, haven&rsquo;t you? How terrible&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.z1bi6nnze6r2-9"><span class="c0">That was the moment Chelsea&rsquo;s life changed forever. Queen Nerissa, the ruler of the mermaid kingdom, had found her. The Queen&rsquo;s compassion was unexpected, almost overwhelming, as she took Chelsea under her wing. Chelsea became her adopted daughter, her trusted servant, her secret spy.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.z1bi6nnze6r2-10"><span class="c0">She willingly adopted the role, happy to contribute to the wellbeing of her fellow mermaids, who she felt were unfairly wronged by the krakens&rsquo; cowardly actions.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.z1bi6nnze6r2-11"><span class="c0">But as we&rsquo;ve come to see thus far, war is not so black and white. Chelsea wondered whether she could truly hate krakens like she once did.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.z1bi6nnze6r2-12"><span class="c5">Despite everything, despite her parents being on her mind ever since she lost them, the only person on Chelsea&rsquo;s mind at that current moment was her best friend, Ruby Gillman.</span></p><h2 class="c4 c9" id="h.zdesazpqihcl"><span class="c8 c10">Chapter 18 - Inescapable Guilt</span></h2><p class="c4" id="h.7q6anp8h1t84"><span class="c0">Chelsea swam down to the depths of the ocean, entering a large deep alcove. Within it was a large kingdom made up of sea glass, though the city had seen better days. No longer were the small outer villages and towns populated, not since the war had begun. </span></p><p class="c4" id="h.s319q5inkp6w"><span class="c0">She landed at a large gate decorated with an ornate mural. On one door, a mermaid was painted with her hand outstretched. On the other door, a kraken was painted in the same way, though this half of the mural was scratched out and defaced in deliberate fashion. </span></p><p class="c4" id="h.wqdhc0babi82"><span class="c0">For a few seconds, Chelsea sadly ran her hand along the faded kraken painting, thinking of her friend, Ruby. She had tried not to hurt her too much under those rocks, but Chelsea still didn&rsquo;t know whether her friend would survive. </span></p><p class="c4" id="h.2wk72gzhg71t"><span class="c0">Secretly, she prayed for it. But she also knew that it was probably better if she didn&rsquo;t. </span></p><p class="c4" id="h.vcz8t8t0mbwa"><span class="c0">After all, shouldn&rsquo;t she hate Ruby? Shouldn&rsquo;t she despise krakens, when they took her family from her?</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.5mruk8gdtdiw"><span class="c0">Chelsea shook her head and knocked firmly on the gate. A muffled voice called from the other side.<br>&ldquo;State your name and business!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.5mruk8gdtdiw-13"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Chelsea,&rdquo; she yelled. &ldquo;I bring a gift.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.5mruk8gdtdiw-14"><span class="c0">The gates creaked open with an agonizing slowness, revealing the wary faces of soldiers and refugees huddled within the city&rsquo;s walls. Their expressions shifted as their eyes fell on the object Chelsea carried&mdash;the trident, its golden prongs gleaming with an otherworldly glow. A murmur rippled through the crowd.</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.5mruk8gdtdiw-15"><span class="c12 c5 c11">&ldquo;The trident&hellip;&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;She found it&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.5mruk8gdtdiw-16"><span class="c0">The whispers clawed at Chelsea&rsquo;s composure. She tightened her grip on the weapon, feeling its weight in her hands&mdash;not just its physical heft but the crushing burden of what it represented. She moved forward, avoiding their gazes, her steps purposeful as she made her way to the glass castle at the heart of the city.</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.5mruk8gdtdiw-17"><span class="c0">Inside, the atmosphere was tense. Queen Nerissa, regal and commanding, stood at the center of a grand chamber, her shimmering tail coiled beneath her as she reviewed maps and battle plans with her advisors. The queen&rsquo;s crown, a masterpiece of coral and pearls, rested on her brow like a beacon of authority, though there was no mistaking the weariness in her features. The war had taken its toll on her, just as it had on everyone.</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.5mruk8gdtdiw-18"><span class="c0">One of the advisors, a stern-faced merman, spoke with exasperation. &ldquo;Your Majesty, relying on that girl is a mistake. She&rsquo;s too young, a mere child&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.5mruk8gdtdiw-19"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone through hell just like the rest of us,&rdquo; Nerissa interrupted sharply. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s proven herself worthy of the right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.5mruk8gdtdiw-20"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But sending her into the crypt was reckless,&rdquo; the advisor argued. &ldquo;Even you wouldn&rsquo;t dare enter such a place, Your Majesty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.5mruk8gdtdiw-21"><span class="c0">Nerissa fixed him with a steely glare. &ldquo;Perhaps you underestimate both her and me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.5mruk8gdtdiw-22"><span class="c0">It was then that Nerissa noticed Chelsea standing in the doorway. The queen&rsquo;s eyes lit up with a mixture of surprise and approval as she swam forward.</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.5mruk8gdtdiw-23"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Chelsea,&rdquo; she said, her voice softer now. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve returned&hellip; and with the trident, no less. My word, you&rsquo;ve </span><span class="c5">truly</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;done it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.5mruk8gdtdiw-24"><span class="c0">Chelsea bowed her head, her grip on the trident tightening. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve completed what you asked, Mother.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.5mruk8gdtdiw-25"><span class="c0">Nerissa reached out, touching her daughter&rsquo;s cheek affectionately. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done well, my child. This is a moment of triumph. Why do you look so troubled?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.5mruk8gdtdiw-26"><span class="c0">Chelsea hesitated, her voice trembling. &ldquo;Ruby&hellip; it wasn&rsquo;t necessary&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.5mruk8gdtdiw-27"><span class="c0">Nerissa&rsquo;s expression darkened, her hand falling away. &ldquo;Chelsea,&rdquo; she said firmly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve discussed this. Sacrifices are unavoidable in war. You cannot let sentiment cloud your judgment. Don&rsquo;t tell me you feel for that kraken?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.5mruk8gdtdiw-28"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She was my friend,&rdquo; Chelsea whispered. &ldquo;Without her&hellip; I wouldn&rsquo;t have found the trident.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.5mruk8gdtdiw-29"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then be grateful for her usefulness,&rdquo; Nerissa replied coldly. &ldquo;But do not dwell on it. The past is behind us, and the future demands our focus. Now, come. We have much to prepare.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.k93spcdiuux4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Chelsea frowned. &ldquo;Yes, mother&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><hr><p class="c4 c6" id="h.jz57c8ibogsp"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1" id="h.bqajm55cdo88"><span class="c0">Nerissa swam to the castle balcony, her posture regal as she surveyed her aging kingdom. She raised her hand, and from the depths of the sea, a surge of energy pulsed outward. The water around them churned violently, glowing faintly with a mystical light. Chelsea, who stood alongside her, recognized the spell&mdash;it was a call to arms, a summoning of the mermaid forces.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.bqajm55cdo88-30"><span class="c0">Dozens of mermaids appeared, their forms sleek and powerful, their eyes filled with determination. They surrounded Nerissa, awaiting her command.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.bqajm55cdo88-31"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tonight,&rdquo; Nerissa began, her voice echoing over the kingdom, &ldquo;we strike a blow for all mermaids who have suffered under the cruelty of humans and krakens alike. Tonight, we remind them of our strength, our unity. Let them tremble before the might of the sea!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.bqajm55cdo88-32"><span class="c0">The mermaids cheered, their voices rising in unison. Chelsea&rsquo;s stomach churned as she watched them, their fervor a stark contrast to the turmoil in her own heart.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.bqajm55cdo88-33"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Chelsea,&rdquo; Nerissa said, turning to her daughter. &ldquo;You will lead by my side. Show them the strength of a true daughter of the sea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.bqajm55cdo88-34"><span class="c0">Chelsea&rsquo;s blood ran cold. She opened her mouth to protest, to beg for another way, but the words wouldn&rsquo;t come. Nerissa&rsquo;s gaze was unyielding, her faith in Chelsea absolute.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.bqajm55cdo88-35"><span class="c0">Swallowing hard, Chelsea nodded. &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; she said, her voice barely audible.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.bqajm55cdo88-36"><span class="c0">The mermaids began to spread out of the alcove, ascending to the surface in preparation for the assault. Chelsea lingered at the rear of the group, her hands trembling as she clutched the hem of her dress.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.bqajm55cdo88-37"><span class="c5 c11">I can&rsquo;t do this</span><span class="c5">, she thought, her heart pounding. </span><span class="c12 c5 c11">I can&rsquo;t hurt them. I already hurt her once before.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.2fwm0n71p7s0"><span class="c0">Chelsea closed her eyes.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.bqajm55cdo88-38"><span class="c12 c5 c11">Ruby&hellip; please forgive me. I&rsquo;ll make this right. I swear it.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.bqajm55cdo88-39"><span class="c0">The battle hadn&rsquo;t yet begun, but Chelsea knew she was already fighting the hardest war of all&mdash;the one within herself.</span></p><p class="c4 c6" id="h.kit9r3pshnvp"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6" id="h.ropubyamju2z"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6" id="h.bqajm55cdo88-40"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6" id="h.bm4aysjzpeng"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4 c9" id="h.tf8z061mbfpg"><span class="c10">Chapter 19 - Monsters From Below</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they ascended toward the surface, the dim light of the ocean casting shifting shadows around them, Chelsea turned to Nerissa with a reluctant frown. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mother&hellip; is this really necessary?&rdquo; Chelsea asked, her voice trembling just enough to betray her inner conflict.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nerissa paused mid-stroke, her regal composure unshaken. Her golden fins shimmered faintly as she turned to face Chelsea, her expression stern yet not unkind. &ldquo;Have you forgotten what they did to you, Chelsea? The pain you&rsquo;ve carried for ten long years?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea&rsquo;s lips tightened. The memories Nerissa spoke of&mdash;the red sea, the suffocating stench, the empty void her parents left behind&mdash;rose to the surface of her mind like an unwelcome tide. Yet even those memories didn&rsquo;t feel strong enough to justify what they were about to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t forgotten,&rdquo; Chelsea admitted softly, her gaze drifting downward. &ldquo;But&hellip; </span><span class="c5">what</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;if&hellip; we&rsquo;re wrong? What if there&rsquo;s another way? Can&rsquo;t we just&hellip; sit down and talk?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nerissa&rsquo;s frown deepened, her jaw tightening. For a brief moment, her eyes softened with a flicker of something&mdash;pain? Regret? It was gone just as quickly. &ldquo;Do you think I didn&rsquo;t try, dear? I sought peace long ago, when this war first began. I reached out, extended the hand of diplomacy. But the krakens&hellip; they didn&rsquo;t listen. They never do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea bit her lip. &ldquo;But Ruby&mdash;she&rsquo;s not like them. She&rsquo;s different. She has nothing to do with this. Can&rsquo;t we&hellip; can&rsquo;t we let her live, at least? Please, Mother. I really care about her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For the first time, Nerissa&rsquo;s mask of calm cracked, if only slightly. A shadow passed over her face, her piercing eyes locking with Chelsea&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Your parents had nothing to do with the war, either. But the krakens took them anyway. They didn&rsquo;t hesitate. They didn&rsquo;t spare them because they were innocent. And they won&rsquo;t spare us if we falter.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea felt her chest tighten as Nerissa&rsquo;s words cut deep. &ldquo;For the sake of those we&rsquo;ve lost,&rdquo; the Queen continued, her tone colder now, more resolute, &ldquo;you must forget such dangerous attachments.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea&rsquo;s throat constricted, and she closed her eyes in an effort to hold back the tears welling up. She knew that arguing further would only harden Nerissa&rsquo;s resolve. Her mother, the woman who had saved her, who had given her a purpose, wasn&rsquo;t one to yield&mdash;not even to her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry, Mom,&rdquo; Chelsea whispered at last, her voice breaking slightly. &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo; The words tasted bitter in her mouth, each syllable a betrayal of the one person she couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nerissa&rsquo;s expression softened once more, and she reached out, gently rubbing Chelsea&rsquo;s hair. There was a certain pride in her smile, though Chelsea couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to meet her eyes. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my girl,&rdquo; Nerissa said warmly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make your parents proud tonight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chelsea forced herself to nod, though her hands shook uncontrollably behind her back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&hellip; I&rsquo;ll make them proud,&rdquo; she echoed, the words barely audible. She clenched her fists to steady them, the pain of her nails digging into her palms a welcome distraction from the storm inside her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Nerissa began swimming toward the surface once more, Chelsea lingered for a moment, her heart pounding in her chest. The water seemed to press in on her, suffocating, as if the ocean itself could sense her turmoil.</span></p><p class="c4 c6" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4 c9" id="h.e0bafkgyrjv"><span class="c10">Chapter 20 - Parallels of the Past</span></h2><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-41"><span class="c0">On the surface of Oceanside&rsquo;s waters, a small yacht was the host of that year&rsquo;s Sea Sparkle Prom. Laughter and music drifted across the waves, mixing with the soft glow of lanterns strung along the deck. </span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-42"><span class="c0">Of course, Ruby Gillman, like any teenager, really wanted to go. But even if she wasn&rsquo;t a kraken, which made things impossible, she had no way of being there. She was currently somewhere under some sea rock, ruminating over the betrayal of her best friend. </span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-43"><span class="c0">And on the surface, the yacht wasn&rsquo;t the only thing visible. </span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-44"><span class="c0">From the depths, towering figures emerged&mdash;dozens of them, their sleek forms cutting through the surface like sharpened blades. Gasps and screams filled the air as partygoers stumbled back, pressing themselves against the railings in disbelief. Mermaids, once mystical, now proven to exist. It would have been an unbelievable sight once upon a time. </span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-45"><span class="c0">For a moment, the world seemed to stand still.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-46"><span class="c0">The yacht&rsquo;s captain barely had time to react, gripping the wheel with white-knuckled hands as they veered the vessel away from the rising figures. A wave crashed against the side of the boat, sending champagne glasses shattering across the deck.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-47"><span class="c0">Chelsea broke the surface alongside her mother, Queen Nerissa, her pulse quickening as her gaze landed on the boat. The familiar voices of her classmates carried across the water, their panic striking a chord deep within her. She could picture their wide-eyed terror, the way they clung to each other as if their fragile world might collapse at any moment.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-48"><span class="c0">A flicker of something stirred in her chest&mdash;guilt, regret, something she had been trying to bury.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-49"><span class="c0">Chelsea clenched her fists.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-50"><span class="c0">She could point them out. With one word, she could direct her mother&rsquo;s attention to the yacht. It would be easy. A distraction, an example, a warning.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-51"><span class="c0">But she didn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-52"><span class="c0">Instead, she looked away, her lips pressing into a tight line. She had already ruined one friendship. She refused to ruin this night for them, too. Perhaps it was guilt. Perhaps it was something else. Either way, she found herself unable to raise the alarm.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-53"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mamah, where are you?&rdquo; Nerissa&rsquo;s voice cut through the waters, her tone sharp and laced with venom. &ldquo;Your old friend has arrived&mdash;to watch you perish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-54"><span class="c0">Agatha swam into view, her expression twisted with fury. &ldquo;You&hellip; What have you brought?&rdquo; she demanded, her voice trembling with restrained anger.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-55"><span class="c0">Nerissa&rsquo;s lips curled into a mocking smile. &ldquo;Agatha, isn&rsquo;t it? Where is your mother? I&rsquo;m eager to meet her&hellip; to settle unfinished business.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-56"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Queen Nerissa,&rdquo; Agatha said firmly, though her voice carried a desperate edge. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bring your war here to the surface. Take it back to the depths.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-57"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, concerned about casualties, are we?&rdquo; Nerissa asked, her tone dripping with sarcasm. &ldquo;How ironic, considering you were the one who set everything into motion.&rdquo; She cast a sidelong glance at Chelsea, whose frown deepened under the weight of Nerissa&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-58"><span class="c0">Agatha&rsquo;s eyes widened as they fell upon Chelsea, recognition dawning in a horrifying instant. &ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; Her voice broke. &ldquo;What have you done to my daughter?!&rdquo; She pointed at Chelsea, trembling with both grief and fury.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-59"><span class="c0">Chelsea avoided her gaze, her lips trembling. &ldquo;I&hellip; I got my revenge,&rdquo; she murmured hesitantly, her voice heavy with regret. &ldquo;For what you took from me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-60"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Agatha surged forward, her arms outstretched, but Nerissa blocked her with a swipe of her arm.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-61"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Control yourself, Agatha,&rdquo; Nerissa said with a sinister grin. &ldquo;Surely, you understand&hellip; an eye for an eye.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-62"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; Agatha screamed, lunging at her, but Nerissa easily parried her blows with the trident in hand, her strength effortlessly overpowering Agatha.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-63"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Perhaps I should finish you off right now,&rdquo; Nerissa said coldly, raising the trident above her head.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-64"><span class="c0">But a voice rang out behind her, commanding and filled with authority.<br>&ldquo;Nerissa.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-65"><span class="c0">The mermaid queen froze mid-strike, her grin widening as she slowly turned. &ldquo;Well, if it isn&rsquo;t the traitor herself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-66"><span class="c0">Grandmamah appeared, her regal presence undeniable despite the tension thickening the air. Her sharp gaze flicked between Nerissa and the chaos surrounding them. &ldquo;What is the meaning of this, Nerissa?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;How have you gotten that trident back?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-67"><span class="c0">Nerissa chuckled, her tone mocking. &ldquo;Like Chelsea here, I&rsquo;m merely reclaiming what was stolen from me. Your precious granddaughter was kind enough to assist.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-68"><span class="c0">Agatha&rsquo;s gaze darted to Chelsea in disbelief. &ldquo;You&hellip; used Ruby, all for this?&rdquo; she whispered, heartbroken.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-69"><span class="c0">Chelsea looked down, her silence speaking volumes.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-70"><span class="c0">Grandmamah, however, remained composed, her voice steady. &ldquo;Nerissa, you&rsquo;ve let vengeance consume you. This path will not lead to peace&mdash;only ruin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-71"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Peace?&rdquo; Nerissa spat. &ldquo;Do you think peace was offered to me when your family tore everything from mine?&rdquo; She twirled the trident, its glowing tips crackling with energy. &ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s no peace left, Grandmamah. Only justice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-72"><span class="c0">The fight erupted, chaos spilling across the waters. Nerissa clashed with both Grandmamah and Agatha, her strength amplified by the trident. Despite their combined efforts, the krakens struggled to match her raw power.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-73"><span class="c0">Amid the chaos, Nerissa&rsquo;s sharp voice pierced the turmoil. &ldquo;Chelsea!&rdquo; she shouted, tossing the trident toward her. &ldquo;Take this. When I distract them, strike them down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-74"><span class="c0">Chelsea caught the weapon but hesitated, her grip uncertain as she stared at the trident&rsquo;s glowing surface. &ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-75"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare hesitate!&rdquo; Nerissa hissed, her voice sharp as a blade.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-76"><span class="c0">Chelsea&rsquo;s hesitation grew, her conflicted emotions written plainly on her face. She raised the trident, aiming at the two krakens locked in battle&mdash;but before she could act, a sudden force tackled her from behind, sending her tumbling into the water.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-77"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you doing, Chelsea?&rdquo; Nerissa growled, glaring at the interruption.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-78"><span class="c0">Chelsea resurfaced, gasping, but now she wasn&rsquo;t alone. A battered and furious Ruby clung to her, her eyes blazing with betrayal.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-79"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You liar!&rdquo; Ruby shouted, her voice breaking. &ldquo;You absolute hypocrite!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-80"><span class="c0">Chelsea&rsquo;s expression softened as she saw Ruby. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re&hellip; alive,&rdquo; she whispered, almost relieved. But her relief was short-lived as Ruby&rsquo;s hand collided with her cheek in a sharp slap. &ldquo;Ow!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-81"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alive? Barely!&rdquo; Ruby growled. &ldquo;And whose fault is it that I almost wasn&rsquo;t? Don&rsquo;t you dare attack my family!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-82"><span class="c0">In the scuffle, Ruby&rsquo;s foot kicked the trident from Chelsea&rsquo;s hands, sending it hurtling into a nearby rock formation where it lodged firmly. Nerissa swam toward it, wrenching it free and unleashing a blast that sent Grandmamah and Agatha tumbling backward.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-83"><span class="c0">Ruby, though weak, swam forward, her body trembling with exhaustion. With sheer determination, she grappled with Nerissa, managing to disarm her momentarily. In a final desperate push, Ruby seized the trident, holding its glowing prongs inches from Nerissa&rsquo;s throat.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-84"><span class="c0">The ocean seemed to hold its breath.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-85"><span class="c0">Ruby hesitated, memories flashing through her mind&mdash;moments of joy and hope she had shared with Chelsea, dreams of peace between their kinds. Her grip on the weapon faltered.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-86"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ruby, what are you doing?&rdquo; Grandmamah called out. &ldquo;End this!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-87"><span class="c0">But Ruby lowered the trident. Her voice, though shaky, was resolute. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This cycle of pain has to stop.&rdquo; She turned to Nerissa, her gaze unwavering. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the granddaughter of the queen of the oceans, and I say this with all my heart&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-88"><span class="c0">The declaration hung in the water like a weight, silencing everyone.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-89"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve suffered at the hands of us krakens, and you didn&rsquo;t deserve such pain,&rdquo; Ruby continued. &ldquo;I know that mermaids are not evil, we&rsquo;re all just&hellip; misunderstood. So, I offer our apologies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-90"><span class="c0">Ruby&rsquo;s grandmother stood frozen, eyes wide with disbelief, but her mother, Agatha, held a quiet, solemn pride in her expression.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-91"><span class="c0">&quot;Apologies?&quot; Nerissa&rsquo;s voice rang out like a tidal wave before she thrust her arm forward, releasing a powerful blast that sent Ruby hurtling backward into the crashing surf. The impact stole the air from her lungs as she tumbled through the water, her body colliding against the ocean floor.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-92"><span class="c0">Nerissa seized the trident in her hands, its power thrumming through her grip as she fixed her gaze upon Ruby. &quot;What about all the years of pain I&rsquo;ve endured? The suffering I&rsquo;ve borne because of your kind? The lives lost at your hands?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-93"><span class="c0">She turned her burning glare toward Grandmamah, who stood firm despite the weight of the accusation. They locked eyes, unyielding forces of will, neither willing to bow.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-94"><span class="c0">&quot;No, apologies aren&rsquo;t enough,&quot; Nerissa spat. &quot;I&rsquo;m going to end this by my own hand.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-95"><span class="c0">Without hesitation, she swung the trident, releasing a bolt of raw energy. It struck Grandmamah with devastating force, sending her crashing into the jagged rockface.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-96"><span class="c0">&quot;Mother!&quot; Agatha gasped, rushing to her side. She grasped her mother&rsquo;s arm, pulling her upright. As she surveyed the destruction, her expression darkened with sorrow. &quot;Mother&hellip; please, end this. For the children&rsquo;s sake.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-97"><span class="c0">&quot;There&rsquo;s no point,&quot; Grandmamah murmured, weariness creeping into her voice.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-98"><span class="c0">&quot;You hear that?&quot; Nerissa turned to Ruby, who floated weakly in the water, arms wrapped around herself as she struggled to stay upright. &quot;Even now, despite the desperate cries for peace, you krakens refuse to yield. If this is the path you insist on taking, then so be it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-99"><span class="c0">With a vicious snarl, Nerissa unleashed another blast from the trident. The energy slammed into Grandmamah, forcing her back against the rocks.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-100"><span class="c0">&quot;Do you remember the pain you caused me, Mamah?&quot; Nerissa seethed, her attacks growing fiercer, each strike fueled by years of resentment. The relentless blasts illuminated the battlefield in flashes of searing light. &quot;Do you remember what we once had? What I sacrificed for you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-101"><span class="c0">As the next burst of energy surged forward, Agatha threw herself in front of Grandmamah, shielding her with her own body. The blast struck her with agonizing force, cutting through her skin like a blade.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-102"><span class="c0">&quot;I&hellip; feel your pain, Queen Nerissa,&quot; Agatha gasped, gritting her teeth against the agony. &quot;But don&rsquo;t you dare attack my mother this way.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-103"><span class="c0">Nerissa&rsquo;s expression did not soften. &quot;I hold no animosity toward you, Agatha. You were nothing more than a pawn in all of this. But if you continue to stand in my way, I will not hesitate to strike you down as well.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-104"><span class="c0">&quot;Then do it!&quot; Agatha cried, her voice breaking as another wave of pain surged through her. &quot;Go ahead!&quot;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-105"><span class="c0">Ruby, barely holding herself above water, felt her heart shatter at the sight of her mother suffering. &quot;Mom&hellip;&quot; she whimpered, her voice barely more than a breath.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-106"><span class="c0">Something inside her snapped.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-107"><span class="c0">With every ounce of strength she had left, Ruby pushed herself upward, her body trembling from exhaustion. Blood trickled down her fingers as she reached for the trident, grasping its prongs with her bare hands. The sheer force of its power seared her skin, but she refused to let go.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-108"><span class="c0">&quot;This ends now!&quot; Ruby hissed, her grip tightening despite the sharp, biting pain.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-109"><span class="c0">Nerissa&rsquo;s eyes flashed with fury. &quot;Stand aside!&quot; she commanded, channeling even greater energy through the weapon.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-110"><span class="c0">&quot;Never!&quot; Ruby snarled, digging her heels into the ocean floor, holding back the trident&rsquo;s overwhelming force with everything she had. The water around them churned violently, responding to the clash of wills between them.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-111"><span class="c0">&quot;Ruby!&quot; Chelsea&rsquo;s voice rang out from the sidelines, filled with desperation. &quot;You can&rsquo;t win against that power!&quot;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-112"><span class="c0">A sharp breath left Ruby&rsquo;s lips as another wave of pain threatened to bring her to her knees. &quot;When have bad odds ever stopped me?&quot; she asked, her voice strained but defiant.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-113"><span class="c0">Nerissa&rsquo;s frustration boiled over. &quot;Why don&rsquo;t krakens ever give up?!&quot; she bellowed.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-114"><span class="c0">&quot;You underestimate us, mermaid queen!&quot; Ruby roared in response.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-115"><span class="c0">With a final crack, the trident shattered, sending power spiraling in all directions. Ruby was thrown backwards several feet, her form shrinking as she collided partially with the prom boat, causing classmates to glance upward in confusion. </span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-116"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ruby!&rdquo; Chelesea looked over worriedly.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-117"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Chelsea&hellip; remember what I told you.&rdquo; Nerissa warned.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-118"><span class="c0">Chelsea turned her back angrily. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this anymore!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-119"><span class="c0">Chelsea swam over to the boat and checked on Ruby, finding her bleeding from her hands and stomach.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-120"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ruby&hellip; are you alright?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-121"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Chelsea&hellip;&rdquo; Ruby looked to the ground. &ldquo;Are you trying to redeem yourself now? After what you did?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-122"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; sorry. I regret every second of that,&rdquo; Chelsea muttered, holding out her hand.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-123"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&hellip; need your help, Chelsea,&rdquo; Ruby said, slapping her hand away. She tried to stand, but stumbled. Chelsea grabbed her before she fell.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-124"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hurt&hellip; there&rsquo;s no reason for you to go back out there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-125"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have to stop this&hellip; Chelsea, you said it yourself, and I agreed with it&hellip; the more we fight, the harder it becomes to determine the exact reason why.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-126"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please&hellip; don&rsquo;t hurt yourself like this&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-127"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stop it, Chelsea. Don&rsquo;t try to act innocent after you pushed me away first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-128"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore. I don&rsquo;t want to see you kill yourself for&hellip; all of this. I lost my light once before; I don&rsquo;t want to lose it again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-129"><span class="c0">Chelsea pulled Ruby close, pressing a firm yet gentle kiss to her lips. Ruby&rsquo;s breath hitched, her eyes widening in shock. Before she could fully process what had just happened, Chelsea turned to where the fight was taking place and glared. </span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-130"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mother! Please, stop this madness!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-131"><span class="c0">Nerissa&rsquo;s eyes narrowed, her grip tightening around the remains of the trident. The swirling currents around her surged in response to her fury. &ldquo;Chelsea, what nonsense are you spouting?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-132"><span class="c0">Chelsea clenched her fists, her voice trembling with frustration. &ldquo;Look at what you&rsquo;re doing! You&rsquo;re not ending suffering&mdash;you&rsquo;re only creating more of it by prolonging this war!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-133"><span class="c0">Nerissa&rsquo;s lips curled into a cold sneer. &ldquo;I will end it. Permanently.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-134"><span class="c0">Chelsea shook her head, her eyes filled with defiance. &ldquo;Then do whatever you want! It doesn&rsquo;t matter to me anymore because you&rsquo;re not my real mother! And I refuse to stand with someone who would hurt my friend like this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-135"><span class="c0">Ruby, still recovering from the shock of both the kiss and Chelsea&rsquo;s declaration, looked up at her in disbelief. &ldquo;Chelsea&hellip; what are you&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-136"><span class="c0">Chelsea turned to her with a soft, bittersweet smile. &ldquo;Making the right choice,&rdquo; she whispered. With gentle hands, she helped Ruby to her feet, supporting her weight.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-137"><span class="c0">Ruby gazed into Chelsea&rsquo;s eyes, searching for any sign of hesitation. What she found instead was a raw mixture of sadness, conviction, and something else&mdash;something deep and unspoken. </span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-138"><span class="c0">With a quiet chuckle, Ruby tilted her head, a melancholic smile playing on her lips. &ldquo;Is this your way of being sincere?&rdquo; she murmured, leaning just a little closer.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-139"><span class="c0">A flicker of something passed through Chelsea&rsquo;s eyes before she let out a small laugh. &ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-140"><span class="c0">Nerissa&rsquo;s eyes widened as she saw Chelsea and Ruby standing side by side. It was a sight she never could have imagined&mdash;an injured kraken leaning against a mermaid for support, their differences forgotten in the face of something greater.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-141"><span class="c0">In the oceanic history books, that moment was solidified forever as a true point of change. It proved that mermaids and krakens could stand together, helping one another without prejudice.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-142"><span class="c0">Where had this symbol of peace been all those years?</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-143"><span class="c0">Nerissa was struck with an extreme feeling of sadness.</span></p><p class="c16 c6" id="h.cqpnsimcvgsn-144"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4 c9" id="h.aan3q6wivnqo"><span class="c8 c10">Chapter 21 - Kraken and Mermaid</span></h2><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva"><span class="c0">Nerissa turned to Grandmamah, her face a mix of sadness and anger, eyes shimmering with unshed tears. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked, her voice trembling. &ldquo;Why has all this happened? What are we even fighting for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-145"><span class="c0">Grandmamah frowned, her expression shadowed by a confusion that seemed to age her further. &ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; She hesitated, the weight of years pressing visibly on her shoulders. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo; Her voice cracked. &ldquo;I&hellip; I&rsquo;ve hurt you so much, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-146"><span class="c0">Nerissa let out a bitter laugh, sharp and cold like shattered glass. &ldquo;At least you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-147"><span class="c0">The remains of the trident, once a symbol of their shared legacy and power, slipped from her hands and sank into the water with a quiet splash. She watched it descend, the ripples breaking the silence between them.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-148"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired,&rdquo; she said softly, her voice carrying the weight of battles long fought and lost. &ldquo;Tired of all this fighting. Tired of the violence, the destruction&hellip; tired of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-149"><span class="c0">Grandmamah&rsquo;s gaze dropped, shame flickering across her face like a dying ember. &ldquo;I&hellip; I feel it too,&rdquo; she admitted, her voice barely audible. &ldquo;Shame for what I&rsquo;ve done to you. For betraying your trust. I don&rsquo;t know why I did what I did. But I do know&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-150"><span class="c0">Nerissa&rsquo;s jaw tightened, her emotions a battlefield of conflicting desires. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll ever be able to forgive you,&rdquo; she said, her tone hollow. &ldquo;But&hellip; I understand how you feel.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-151"><span class="c0">Grandmamah glanced at her, hesitant yet hopeful. &ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; she said slowly, her voice trembling, &ldquo;our granddaughters are wiser than either of us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-152"><span class="c0">Nerissa allowed a faint, sorrowful smile to cross her lips. &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-153"><span class="c0">Their gazes shifted toward Ruby and Chelsea, who now sat side by side, their shoulders lightly touching. Despite everything that had transpired&mdash;the betrayals, the heartbreak, the destruction&mdash;there was a quiet sense of peace between the two.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-154"><span class="c0">For a moment, Nerissa and Grandmamah stood in silence, reflecting on the countless choices and mistakes that had led them to this point.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-155"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I suppose&hellip;&rdquo; Nerissa began, her voice tinged with resignation, &ldquo;we should end this. For their sake.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-156"><span class="c0">Grandmamah nodded slowly. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she said with a faint smile, her eyes misty, &ldquo;you always were a great friend.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-157"><span class="c0">Nerissa turned away, a hint of a smile tugging at the corners of her mouth. &ldquo;And you always were as stubborn as a mule.&rdquo;</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c6" id="h.cx6ehowyx461"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-158"><span class="c0">On the boat&rsquo;s upper deck, Ruby glanced between the two elder sea queens, her heart pounding. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve stopped&hellip;&rdquo; she muttered in disbelief.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-159"><span class="c0">Chelsea tilted her head, studying the scene below. &ldquo;I think&hellip; they&rsquo;re ending it. For us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-160"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But all the animosity,&rdquo; Ruby said, her voice tinged with doubt. &ldquo;All the anger&mdash;how can they just let it go?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-161"><span class="c0">Chelsea&rsquo;s lips curved into a sad, rueful smile. &ldquo;What good is anger?&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;Look where mine got me. I hurt you, Ruby. I hurt your home, your people&hellip; all because of some stupid, petty revenge.&rdquo; Her voice faltered, and she turned away. &ldquo;And now&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-162"><span class="c0">Ruby opened her mouth as if to speak, then stopped herself, the words sticking in her throat. She stared at Chelsea for a long moment before finally saying, &ldquo;I&hellip; I want to be angry.&rdquo; Her voice wavered, heavy with unspoken emotions. &ldquo;But&hellip; friends don&rsquo;t hold grudges, do they?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-163"><span class="c0">Chelsea&rsquo;s shoulders slumped, and she shook her head. &ldquo;You have every right to be angry,&rdquo; she whispered, her voice trembling. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t blame you if you hated me forever.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-164"><span class="c0">Ruby hesitated before giving a small, bittersweet smile. &ldquo;Chelsea,&rdquo; she began softly, &ldquo;when we first met, you told me you&rsquo;d be the best fake friend I&rsquo;d ever have. But you were never just a fake friend to me. You were more than that.&rdquo; She took a deep breath, her resolve strengthening. &ldquo;So&hellip; prove it. Prove to me that your friendship was real. Then maybe&hellip; just maybe, you can regain my trust.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-165"><span class="c0">Chelsea&rsquo;s eyes widened, tears spilling over as she stared at Ruby in disbelief. &ldquo;Ruby&hellip; are you sure?&rdquo; she asked, her voice cracking.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-166"><span class="c0">Ruby&rsquo;s smile softened, a flicker of playfulness returning to her expression. &ldquo;Have I ever lied?&rdquo; she teased, before adding with a pointed look, &ldquo;Unlike you, of course.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-167"><span class="c0">Despite her tears, Chelsea let out a shaky laugh. &ldquo;Ruby&hellip; your real friends are down there, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; she said, motioning to the prom stage below them, where the music played faintly. &ldquo;I&hellip; I lied to you. Hurt you. Attacked your home. I don&rsquo;t deserve&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-168"><span class="c0">Ruby cut her off, stepping closer and pulling her into a kiss. For a moment, time seemed to stand still as the world around them faded into nothing. When they finally pulled apart, Ruby whispered, &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s okay with you, I&rsquo;d rather stay here. What good are krakens at prom, anyway?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-169"><span class="c0">Chelsea stared at her, stunned, before breaking into laughter, her arms wrapping tightly around Ruby. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m warning you,&rdquo; she said through her tears. &ldquo;Stay with me, and the apologies will never end.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-170"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Ruby replied with a grin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll listen as long as you want. And maybe, if I&rsquo;m feeling like a generous kraken&hellip;&rdquo; She paused, her eyes sparkling mischievously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll forgive you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udot6tpwluva-171"><span class="c0">Chelsea smiled, a deep, genuine smile that carried with it all her gratitude and hope. &ldquo;Thank you, Ruby.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.ox85e43vwier"><span class="c0">Ruby&rsquo;s expression softened, and she smiled back. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Then, with a teasing lilt, she leaned against Chelsea&rsquo;s shoulder, resting her weight against her like it was the most natural thing in the world. &ldquo;Now&hellip; about that kiss&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.ox85e43vwier-172"><span class="c0">Chelsea instantly stiffened, her entire face burning crimson. &ldquo;Aaah!&rdquo; she groaned, covering her face with both hands. &ldquo;You can just forget that ever happened! That was&hellip; um&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.ox85e43vwier-173"><span class="c0">Ruby only laughed, wrapping an arm around Chelsea&rsquo;s waist and pulling her a little closer. &ldquo;It seems we have a lot to talk about,&rdquo; she murmured, voice dripping with amusement. &ldquo;Quite a lot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.ox85e43vwier-174"><span class="c0">Chelsea let out a flustered huff, still red-faced, but there was no real protest in her. Instead, she merely nodded, pouting slightly as Ruby giggled at her expense.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.7h19ukkjm8el"><span class="c0">As their laughter carried far into the night, Ruby found that it wasn&rsquo;t so bad to spend prom with a special person, rather than crowds at a party. </span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c4 c9" id="h.xg2f8lem8mph"><span class="c8 c10">Chapter 22 - New Normal</span></h2><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1"><span class="c0">It was an ordinary morning.</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-175"><span class="c0">Ruby woke up to the familiar glow of sunlight filtering through her curtains, the rhythmic sound of waves crashing in the distance a steady backdrop to her routine.

Then, after a small pause, she smiled. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t get carried away out there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-187"><span class="c0">Ruby chuckled, shaking her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you know me at all, Mom.&rdquo; She grinned as she pulled the door shut behind her. </span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-188"><span class="c0">The streets were quiet, the scent of salt lingering in the air as she strolled toward school. The town of Oceanside was just beginning to stir&mdash;the distant hum of cars, the chatter of early risers, the occasional call of seagulls overhead. It was peaceful.</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-189"><span class="c0">Then, a sudden splash disrupted the calm.</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-190"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo; Chelsea chirped, her voice bright and cheerful, as if she hadn&rsquo;t just emerged from the sea like a myth </span><span class="c5">come</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to life.</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-191"><span class="c0">Ruby didn&rsquo;t break her stride. She huffed, turning her head away with dramatic flair, though the small, reluctant smile tugging at the corners of her lips betrayed her. &ldquo;Hmph,&rdquo; she muttered, feigning indifference.</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-192"><span class="c0">Chelsea frowned, quickening her pace to match Ruby&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Oh, come on, Ruby! You&rsquo;re not still mad at me, are you? I&rsquo;ve apologized a hundred times already!&rdquo; She clasped her hands together in a pleading gesture, her tone exaggeratedly pitiful.</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-193"><span class="c0">Ruby slowed, though she still refused to look at her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in a forgiving mood,&rdquo; she said, her voice carrying the unmistakable lilt of teasing. But then, at last, she cast Chelsea a sideways glance, her smirk threatening to break free. &ldquo;But&hellip; maybe I could be persuaded, if you were to do something for me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-194"><span class="c0">Chelsea narrowed her eyes, suspicion written all over her face. &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-195"><span class="c0">Ruby stopped walking and turned to face her fully, crossing her arms with a playful tilt of her head. &ldquo;How about you treat me to dessert every single day next week?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-196"><span class="c0">Chelsea let out a loud groan, throwing her head back as if Ruby had just sentenced her to eternal suffering. &ldquo;What?! That&rsquo;s robbery!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-197"><span class="c0">Ruby arched a brow, her smirk deepening. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Are mermaids incapable of spending money?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-198"><span class="c0">Chelsea groaned louder, throwing her hands in the air in mock despair. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re evil, you know that? A scheming, greedy kraken.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-199"><span class="c5">Ruby wagged a finger at her, grinning. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re confused. I&rsquo;m pretty sure </span><span class="c5 c11">you&rsquo;re</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;the evil one here, </span><span class="c5">Miss Betrayer</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-200"><span class="c0">Chelsea gasped, clutching her chest as if Ruby&rsquo;s words had physically wounded her. &ldquo;Miss Betrayer?! You&rsquo;re never going to let that go, are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-201"><span class="c0">Ruby rolled her eyes but couldn&rsquo;t suppress a soft chuckle as she resumed walking toward school. &ldquo;Oh, please. You&rsquo;ll live.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-202"><span class="c0">Chelsea quickly jogged to catch up, lowering her voice as if she were about to share a deep, dark secret. &ldquo;Fine. I&rsquo;ll buy you dessert&mdash;but only because I&rsquo;m such an amazing friend.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-203"><span class="c5">Ruby raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;Amazing friend? You?&rdquo; She gave Chelsea a pointed look. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you the same person who </span><span class="c5">tried</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;to sink me and </span><span class="c5">nearly</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;destroyed the town?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-204"><span class="c0">Chelsea waved a dismissive hand. &ldquo;Details. Ancient history.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-205"><span class="c5">Ruby scoffed. &ldquo;That was </span><span class="c5 c11">three weeks ago</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-206"><span class="c0">Chelsea groaned dramatically, covering her face with both hands. &ldquo;Ugh, why do you have such a good memory?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-207"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m a kraken,&rdquo; Ruby replied smugly. &ldquo;And we krakens never forget.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-208"><span class="c5">Chelsea peeked out from between her fingers, her lips twitching despite herself. &ldquo;Fine, fine. You win. Dessert for a week. But you&rsquo;d </span><span class="c5">better</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;appreciate it, Ruby. Do you </span><span class="c5">know</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;how much I could buy for myself with all that money?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-209"><span class="c0">Ruby tilted her head, pretending to ponder. &ldquo;Hmm&hellip; I&rsquo;d imagine not much. What&rsquo;s the mermaid economy even like? Seashells and shiny rocks?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-210"><span class="c0">Chelsea groaned again, this time collapsing dramatically onto Ruby&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Oh my gosh, you&rsquo;re impossible. Absolutely impossible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-211"><span class="c0">Ruby laughed, the sound light and genuine. &ldquo;And yet, you&rsquo;re still here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-212"><span class="c0">Chelsea looked up at her, her lips curving into a soft smile. &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she said, her voice quieter now. &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-213"><span class="c0">For a moment, they walked in companionable silence, the playful banter giving way to something unspoken but deeply felt. Whether it was a subconscious confirmation or something else, they found themselves linking hands as they walked. </span></p><p class="c7" id="h.qxm09fre61io"><span class="c0">Truthfully, Ruby had already forgiven Chelsea&mdash;she had forgiven her the moment she saw that hopeful gleam in her eyes&mdash;but teasing her had been too fun to resist.</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-214"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Chelsea said after a pause, mischief sparking in her gaze, &ldquo;what kind of dessert are we talking about here? Something cheap, right? Like a single cookie? Maybe a baby-sized scoop of ice cream?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-215"><span class="c5">Ruby shot her a look that could only be described as </span><span class="c5">deliciously</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;amused. &ldquo;Oh, no. We&rsquo;re talking about the good stuff. Cakes, parfaits, the works.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-216"><span class="c5">Chelsea groaned again, this time sighing in mock despair. &ldquo;Why did I agree to this? </span><span class="c5">Why?</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-217"><span class="c0">Ruby grinned. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re an amazing friend, remember?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-218"><span class="c5">&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; Chelsea grumbled. &ldquo;This is going to </span><span class="c5">bankrupt</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-219"><span class="c0">Ruby laughed, the sound bright and clear. &ldquo;Well, maybe next time you&rsquo;ll think twice before betraying a kraken.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-220"><span class="c5">Chelsea flashed Ruby a lopsided grin. &ldquo;Oh, I think I&rsquo;m way past that point. At this rate, I might as well start a </span><span class="c5">lifetime</span><span class="c5 c11">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">dessert</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;fund for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-221"><span class="c0">Ruby smirked, a spark of genuine fondness in her eyes. &ldquo;Hm&hellip; that doesn&rsquo;t sound too bad.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-222"><span class="c5">Chelsea sighed but couldn&rsquo;t help laughing along. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky I like you, Ruby. </span><span class="c5">Really</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;lucky.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-223"><span class="c0">Ruby turned back to the sidewalk, her smile softening. &ldquo;Yeah, I know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c7" id="h.p560bw7efbw1-224"><span class="c5">And though neither of them said it aloud, the teasing and laughter between them spoke of a bond that was slowly mending. Even if it took months, or possibly years, as long as they had each other, they would brave the arduous path of forgiveness together. </span></p></body></html>
