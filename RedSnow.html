c17">I</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c12"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4">Maine is one US state that has a history of snow in the winter. In the heart of this state lay the town of Yarmouth. It certainly would be a miracle to visit this town during the holidays without encountering Christmas displays. You see, today was December 6th, 1989, and the citizens of Yarmouth were passionate about their Christmas decorations. Almost every year, they would put up all kinds of decorative pieces. Wreaths, garland, lights, blow ups, whatever you could think of, they would have. About 3 houses down the block, near the cul de sac at the end of the neighborhood, stood a mixed teenage girl who held a clear storage bin full of lights and greenery. The house was lacking in color, and the one thing it was needing was lots of decorating. That&rsquo;s where this girl comes in. Phoebe Buris was a 16 year old sophomore who lived with her uncle at this house ever since her parents died. All of the decorations that were to adorn the house were to be placed by Phoebe. She had to do all of it herself, because her uncle didn&rsquo;t really care about all of that. Phoebe dumps all of the decorations out onto the snow covered grass and sighs. She had purchased all of this stuff with money she saved up, but now it was looking like a massive undertaking. She wanted to just quickly throw something up on the house, but that&rsquo;s not what her parents would have wanted. They always were adamant about Christmas, and she wanted to carry that tradition, despite them not being with her. Phoebe gathers the tangled up lights and tries to pull them apart, to no avail. She musters her strength and prys hard, causing her to stumble into the snow. She sighs again and throws the lights to the side. Suddenly, she began to hear footsteps, and looked up to see a group of girls staring her down. She glances at them angrily. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; One of the girls held out her hand. Phoebe grabs it begrudgingly. &ldquo;You need help here, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; She looks to the ground, flushed. &ldquo;I can handle it...&rdquo; &ldquo;Come now. Let us help you.&rdquo; The group of girls each take turns untangling the lights, until each set was separated. &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; Phoebe eyes them nervously, but then smiles. &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; The other girls smile as well, and they get to work putting up the decorations. Some of the girls put the lights up, others put garland on the stairs inside the house, and Phoebe placed the tree in the living room with the help of another girl. Once everything was finished, Phoebe offered her gratitude. &ldquo;Thank you so much.&rdquo; &ldquo;No problem. It&rsquo;s the holidays after all.&rdquo; Phoebe smiles, but then notices something that catches her eye. &ldquo;Hey...what house is that up there?&rdquo; She points to a house atop the hill at the end of the neighborhood which had only a few decorations. The girls look in that direction and suddenly go quiet. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s...um...well, a boy named Andrew lives there&hellip;&rdquo; The other girls looked to the ground, and some of them had sad expressions. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t celebrate&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Why is that?&rdquo; Silence. No answer. &ldquo;Hey, why is that? Why won&rsquo;t you answer?&rdquo; &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t elaborate further&hellip;&rdquo; They walk off, leaving her to stand there, flabbergasted. She scratches her head, trying to comprehend the event that just occurred. One of her neighbors notices her standing there and shouts. &ldquo;Hey, nice decorations!&rdquo; She jumps, not expecting someone to speak. &ldquo;Oh! Thank you! Say...that boy who lives in the house atop the hill there...why does he not celebrate?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, um...have a nice day!&rdquo; The neighbor quickly walks off. &ldquo;Hey, you didn&rsquo;t answer my question!&rdquo; But he was already gone. &ldquo;What is up with that house?&rdquo; Over the next several hours, she goes from door to door, asking if anyone knows about Andrew on the hill. None of the people she speaks to give her a straight answer. By 8:00 at night, she lay face down in her bed, thinking about Andrew. The next day, she went to school with him and his house in her thoughts. One of her friends greeted her on the way into the classroom. &ldquo;Hey Phoebe!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, Silia, I have a question you might be able to answer.&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;So there&rsquo;s this house up on the hill and someone told me that a boy named Andrew lives there...do you know anything about him?&rdquo; &ldquo;Hm...I don&rsquo;t know a lot...I know he&rsquo;s sitting right over there, though.&rdquo; &ldquo;Huh?!&rdquo; She turns her head and sees a boy about her age writing something in a notebook. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s him?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah. I don&rsquo;t know a whole lot, but...I &nbsp;suggest you ask Dara. She&rsquo;s a senior that has some sort of relation to him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Alright. Thanks, I guess.&rdquo; As class started, Phoebe couldn&rsquo;t help but glance at Andrew ever so often. She did feel like she was being sort of creepy, but at the same time, she was just a little curious. A few hours later, once other classes passed, Phoebe went to visit Dara, who was currently in the student body classroom. She knocks on the door and a student greets her. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Um, I want to speak to Dara&hellip;&rdquo; The student stares for a few minutes and then gets Dara&rsquo;s attention. She comes to the door. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; &ldquo;I...I want to ask you about Andrew&hellip;&rdquo; Dara&rsquo;s eyes go wide, and she pulls Phoebe inside. She motions to a desk. &ldquo;Sit here&hellip;&rdquo; Phoebe sits down, and Dara sits next to her. She sighs. &ldquo;So you want to know about Andrew&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah...why does he refuse to celebrate? Is there some cynical-&rdquo; Dara stops her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like that.&rdquo; A tear rolls down her cheek. Phoebe looks at her, shocked at this. &ldquo;Dara?&rdquo; &ldquo;Around 5 years ago...Andrew used to have the best house in this neighborhood. Him and his family always decorated the best out of anyone. They were good people. I should know; I was friends with his sister, Agatha. She was such a saint. She was so friendly, so kind. I&rsquo;ll never meet another girl like her. Andrew and Agatha...they were super close...one could have sworn they were more than just siblings. They always decorated the house together and their skills were unmatched.&rdquo; Another tear rolls down her cheek. &ldquo;Apparently...their fireplace stopped working in november, so they got it replaced by a different company. This company, however...was not the best. The installation was faulty. One cold day, about 4 days before Christmas, Andrew went out to get new lights. With the new fireplace being badly installed, a fire started and Agatha perished in the blaze. The family was never the same, and I&hellip;&rdquo; Dara wipes off a few more tears. &ldquo;I still haven&rsquo;t gotten over it&hellip;&rdquo; She turns away, not wanting to say anymore. The other students in the room walk over to Dara and console her. Phoebe, frozen in shock, leaves the room quietly. She never felt so bad for anyone. He was almost in the same situation she was in. The rest of the school day, Phoebe could not stop thinking about Andrew. On one hand, she felt sympathy, but on the other hand, she felt they must have a connection with their similar backgrounds. That afternoon, she went up the hill towards Andrew&rsquo;s house. In her hands was a box of chocolates. She reaches the front porch and prepares to knock, but then she sees him heading towards a cemetery on the left side of the hill. She places the box on one of the porch chairs and goes down after him. Reaching the cemetery, she hides behind a tree. She watches as he kneels at a tombstone and places a bouquet of roses in the snow. He places his hand on the stone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry&hellip;&rdquo; He then looks up to the sky. &ldquo;God&hellip;&rdquo; He starts to cry. &ldquo;Why did you take her? Why didn&rsquo;t you punish me instead?&rdquo; Phoebe places a hand over her mouth. </span><span class="c4 c16">I shouldn&rsquo;t be watching this, should I? </span><span class="c2">She starts to walk away, but then she hears a faint humming, or maybe it was singing? She returns to the tree and peers over at Andrew. He was still looking to the sky, but this time he softly sang a song:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I know it was bad what we did</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">And I know we shouldn&rsquo;t have hid...</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">But we were only just kids!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">and if anyone needed to be punished...</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">It was me</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">God, why did you take her?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">You didn&rsquo;t need to punish her</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">It was me who started it all...</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">You have no idea how I suffered...</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The pain that I felt</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">When I saw the fire light up the sky...</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">It was a sin</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">A sin</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">A sin!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">But it was my sin, not hers...</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Yet you chose to take her away from me! </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">You left us all in misery for...what?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">My retribution? </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I know it was wrong</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">It shouldn&rsquo;t have lasted so damn long...</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">But we loved each other dearly</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">It should have been my death, really!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I know you won&rsquo;t believe me, but&hellip;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">It should have been mine!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Mine!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Mine!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Mine...</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Not hers...</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">God, why did you take her?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Why...</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Why...</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Why...</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">My dear sister...</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I know you hear my pleas</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m begging on my...my...</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Damn knees!</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">For forgiveness! </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">It was all me...</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I was the one who encouraged it</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">You were the one who was hesitant...</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I should have listened to you...</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">And now...</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">God!

It was quiet in the cemetery, but one could still hear his sobs. Phoebe had her back against the tree and she was crying as well. All of the memories of her parents and the things she felt when they died were coming back to her. She started to feel really guilty for even attempting to make him like her. </span><span class="c4 c16">I really shouldn&rsquo;t be watching this...I should have left. </span><span class="c4">Phoebe slowly walks backwards, when </span><span class="c19">crack! </span><span class="c2">She steps on a tree branch. Andrew looks over and sees her attempting to walk away. He runs over and grabs her by the collar. She looks at him with fear in her eyes. &ldquo;No, no! Let go of me! I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo; &ldquo;Why were you watching? Tell me!&rdquo; &ldquo;I...I just wanted to talk to you&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;If you thought you could confess or something, then you are mistaken! I don&rsquo;t need anyone else. You don&rsquo;t know how close me and my sister were. Nothing will replace that!&rdquo; Phoebe suddenly realizes what he&rsquo;s saying. &ldquo;If...if you two were doing...those things, then her death must be some sort of punishment for you from God.&rdquo; &ldquo;Shut the hell up!&rdquo; He tosses her to the ground and she runs away in fright. Phoebe heads back to her home and locks herself in her room. Her uncle inquires about her actions. &ldquo;Phoebe, what the hell are you doing?&rdquo; &ldquo;N-nothing. I was just trying to get home before it got late&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Right.&rdquo; He sits back down on the couch. Phoebe sat on her bed, shaking from head to toe. She went to sleep with Andrew, Agatha, and her parents in her thoughts. It was really late when she finally fell into a peaceful slumber. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.br9tnfe0e6di"><span class="c17 c20">II</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4">When the snow fell on December 21st, 1984, it was as light and soft as a cloud. It was cold, but not cold enough to freeze your face off. Along the town of Yarmouth, decorations lined the streets. The people of this town valued their decorations. Currently, if you were to look up on the hill, you would see two 12 year old kids, each climbing ladders that were dangerously close to tipping over. But their young faces were full of happiness and joy. 12 year old Andrew placed a set of lights on a high tree and climbed back down. He pressed a button, expecting to see their lights in action, but nothing happened. &ldquo;Aggy!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; &ldquo;These lights are dead!&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you kidding me? I just checked those!&rdquo; She storms down the ladder and snatches the remote from his hands. &ldquo;Let me see.&rdquo; She presses the button. Again, nothing happened. She throws it to the ground. &ldquo;Dang!&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go get some more. You should stay in the house until I get back.&rdquo; &ldquo;Huh? Why do I need to stay inside?&rdquo; &ldquo;If anything was to happen to you, like a ladder falling for example, then I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to help.&rdquo; She rolls her eyes and smiles. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be fine! Don&rsquo;t worry!&rdquo; Andrew sighs. &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; He prepares to leave, but Agatha stops him. &ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; She looks to the ground bashfully. &ldquo;B-be careful yourself.&rdquo; Andrew smiles. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; They smile at each other for a few minutes, and then he heads off, walking carefully down the steep hill in the inner city. As he went through the busy streets, people waved and called out to him. He didn&rsquo;t hesitate to acknowledge them. &ldquo;Hey! How&rsquo;s it going! Merry Christmas!&rdquo; &ldquo;Same to you!&rdquo; After a few minutes, he finally reached his destination: a small CVS on the corner. Its glowing red letters were clearly visible amongst the grey backdrop of the city. In fact, they were even more accentuated by the red and green christmas lights that adorned the walls and windows. Truly, the only reason Andrew and his family frequented this store was because of how cheap their prices were. That, and they were very close by. Once inside, Andrew grabbed three boxes of lights and placed them on the counter. The cashier, who knew all of his family, smiled at him. &ldquo;Back again?&rdquo; &ldquo;These lights seem to never be built to last.&rdquo; She laughs. &ldquo;If you want good lights then you should go to Wal-Mart.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s just easier to come here.&rdquo; &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; She scans the lights and he hands her a ten dollar bill. She gives him his change, and he leaves. Andrew smiles to himself. He always liked being out in the city at this time of year. Just seeing the decorations put up on buildings and the cheer on peoples faces made him feel warm inside. As he continued on his way, he noticed a nearby meat shop which had a beautiful roast spinning on a fire. </span><span class="c4 c16">That might be good for Christmas dinner</span><span class="c4">, he thought. He heads back into the neighborhood and heads on to the trail that led up the hill. Suddenly, he began to smell smoke. His eyes went wide and he quickly ran towards their driveway. He stops in his tracks, the CVS plastic bag falling from his hand. Flames had engulfed the entire house, and the two trees that sat outside the front were both completely destroyed. The innocent snow, which continued to fall around him, reflected the red-orangish hue of the fire, as he stood with a saddened expression. Suddenly, a horrible, terrible, unfortunate thought entered his head. His sister was still inside. He began to call out to her, hoping she could still be there, protected from the fire. &ldquo;Sis! Agatha! Agatha...Aggy&hellip;&rdquo; He fell on his knees, tears beginning to roll down face. As he sat in the snow crying in his despair, the sound of a car pulling up reached his ears. His parents departed the vehicle and quickly ran towards him. His mother puts her hands over her mouth. &ldquo;No&hellip;No!&rdquo; As Andrew held his head down, his father leaned down to face him with worry. &ldquo;Where is your sister? Where is she?&rdquo; Andrew said nothing. He just shook his head. His father realizes the terrible truth. &ldquo;No...not Agatha!&rdquo; He started to cry as well. They all sat there watching the house fall prey to the flames, the reddish hue reflecting off of their eyes. After a few minutes, and one sad, quiet phone call, the fire department arrived and put out the rest of the fire. Medical services entered the house following this, and they returned 20 minutes later. In their hands, they carried a gurney, and on it was a small figure wrapped in cloth. Andrew needed no one to tell him who it was. He slammed his fist on the ground. His parents couldn&rsquo;t bring themselves to look. He walks over and tries to enter the ambulance, but they close the doors before he could. One of the medical personnel puts a hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. There&rsquo;s not a high chance she could still be alive.&rdquo; Andrew turns away from him. &ldquo;Where was she?&rdquo; &ldquo;They found her in a boy&rsquo;s bedroom.&rdquo; Andrew&rsquo;s eyes went wide, and tears started to well up again. &ldquo;She...she locked herself in my room?&rdquo; &ldquo;It seems that way...they found her in the fetal position.&rdquo; Andrew&rsquo;s face began to contort into a mix of anger and sadness. </span><span class="c4 c16">She had so little time to live...and she spent her last moments thinking of me.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;He walks away, crying quietly. Over the next couple of days, the news hardly got better. Agatha couldn&rsquo;t be saved; she died from asphyxiation. Her funeral and burial was held on December 25th. Though they could have rebuilt their house relatively soon, Andrew couldn&rsquo;t go near it without breaking down. The rest of the family spent December at his grandparents&rsquo; house, and the construction was delayed to the summer of the following year. It was really quiet, and no one attempted to celebrate. They still had Christmas dinner, but it was the dreariest dinner ever. They were able to recover all of the presents, but the usual cheer of opening them was completely lost. They were constantly reminded of the fire with every gift, as the wrapping paper was blackened and faded. Andrew couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to open any gifts his sister had given him. Once time had passed, they returned to their newly rebuilt home in silence. One of the first things Andrew did was place the gifts his sister had gotten him in the back of his closet. All of his sister&rsquo;s belongings had been placed in storage bins by the construction crews. Though his mother wanted to sell some of those items to those in need, Andrew forbade her from doing it. He kept all of her items in his closet alongside the presents. One hot July day, Andrew went into his sister&rsquo;s room, which remained intact through the fire, despite the amount of damage. He couldn&rsquo;t help but cry. He takes a picture frame from off of her dresser and studies it sadly. It contained a photograph of them giving peace signs, while on a trip. He places it face down on the dresser and gets on his knees. He starts to pray. Midway through, he stopped and put his head down on Agatha&rsquo;s bed. Tears started to well up again and he cried. All the while, his parents watched from the doorframe with frowns on their faces. In present day, Andrew sat with his head down on Agatha&rsquo;s tombstone, tears rolling down his face. He kept repeating a single phrase in his sadness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m&hellip;&rdquo; He sighs. Suddenly, a bright light caught his eye. He began to hear the sound of tracks being made in the snow. He turns around and comes eye to eye with Agatha. She had an angelic glow around her, and a faint outline of wings on her back. Andrew quickly turns back to face the tombstone. &ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; &ldquo;You put all this pressure on yourself, yet...it wasn&rsquo;t your fault. Won&rsquo;t you look at me? I&rsquo;m here to see you, brother.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deserve to look upon you. Especially with the sins I have caused.&rdquo; Agatha frowns. &ldquo;Do you think I hate you for what you did? I know you just wanted to show how much you loved me&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Who cares what the original intent was?! I committed a sin! As an angel, you should know that!&rdquo; Andrew runs off, distraught and upset. Agatha stood with a sad expression. &ldquo;Brother&hellip;you fool...&rdquo; She vanishes into thin air. Andrew sat in his bedroom, not making a sound. His parents came into the room, full of concern. &ldquo;Andrew&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;....what?&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s time to move on?&rdquo; &ldquo;No. How could you say that?&rdquo; His mother looks to the ground. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone, Andrew. Nothing can change what happened.&rdquo; Andrew seems to ignore her words. &ldquo;Agatha came to me in the cemetery.&rdquo; Their eyes go wide. &ldquo;She was an angel?&rdquo; &ldquo;Of course she was&hellip;&rdquo; His parents look at each other. &ldquo;Maybe she&rsquo;s trying to help you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Help me? What, by making me feel worse?&rdquo; Andrew&rsquo;s parents leave the room, convinced nothing could change his mind. He went to sleep, thinking about his sister, and the things they did. They had sinned, he knew that. On November 15th, the same year his sister died, Andrew had convinced her to do something many would consider shameful. She pushed back a lot, knowing the implications of what he was wanting. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s...it&rsquo;s not right&hellip;&rdquo; Andrew simply didn&rsquo;t listen to her arguments. &ldquo;We love each other, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; &ldquo;But...this isn&rsquo;t the same as that&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well...don&rsquo;t you think our love is good enough?&rdquo; Andrew looks to the ground. &ldquo;I just want to leave proof that I love you.&rdquo; She frowns. &ldquo;Are you telling the truth?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, yes. Of course I am!&rdquo; Agatha looks to the side and sighs. &ldquo;Alright. J-just this once. We can only do it this one time...&rdquo; Andrew nods. He locks his bedroom door, and closes the curtains on the windows. Him and his sister sat on his bed. They locked eyes, and then they started to kiss each other passionately. Yes, what you are reading is true. To the outside world, it just seemed as if Andrew and Agatha were close siblings, but in reality, they were closer than that. However, they had only gone as far as kissing one another. Intimacy was something they hadn&rsquo;t considered and they didn&rsquo;t plan on involving themselves in, which is why Agatha was hesitant when Andrew finally decided to ask her about it. As they continued to kiss, they began to lay on top of each other. Andrew slowly unbuttoned Agatha&rsquo;s shirt, and she avoided looking him in the eyes. He then removes her pants, and unzips his own. Her eyes go wide and she looks to the ground uncomfortably. Andrew notices her discomfort and smiles. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. It&rsquo;ll be over soon.&rdquo; She looks up at him, smiles wryly and then they kiss. Over the next few minutes, Andrew touched her inner body with gentle movements. Agatha said nothing; she only moaned and held him tightly. Suddenly, her expression changed to one that was full of shock. She began to close her eyes and tears rolled down her cheeks. &ldquo;Andrew&hellip;something is building inside of me...I&rsquo;m scared.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok...it&rsquo;s ok, sis...I&rsquo;m here for you...&rdquo; She smiles, and they hold each other as Andrew fills the place he was touching within Agatha. They kiss again, and then Andrew looks to the ground. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for forcing this on you&hellip;&rdquo; Agatha glances at him and smiles sadly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay...I know why you did it.&rdquo; They hug tightly. &ldquo;I love you, sis.&rdquo; &ldquo;I love you, too.&rdquo; They sat there hugging in silence, with smiles on their faces. In the present, Andrew slept in the fetal position, tears rolling down his face. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.wqgedfu510p3"><span class="c20 c17">III</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4">It was December 12th, and Phoebe was having the time of her life. Currently, her and several other students were decorating the classroom. Under the watchful eye of their teacher, they stood on shaky ladders and put garland on the ceiling. Phoebe was certainly happy to be around so many people who supported her. When she first moved to Yarmouth, the greeting was lukewarm at best. Clearly she underestimated the people of this town. When it comes to the holidays, their true colors are always shown. But though everyone was enjoying themselves, Andrew was the only one who sat in the corner, not doing anything. Phoebe glances at him and frowns. She wanted to talk to him, but would he listen after what she did yesterday? She sadly returns to the celebrations. After a few minutes of merrymaking, their teacher brought out candles. Several students were confused. Phoebe picked one of the candles up and studied it. &ldquo;Mrs. Thee...what are these for?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, children, there are things about me that you don&rsquo;t know. My husband of 20 years passed away in 1983, a few days after Christmas. I&rsquo;ve provided these candles for you all to light in remembrance of someone who you&rsquo;ve lost.&rdquo; As soon as she said this, several students grabbed candles and matches. Mrs. Thee smiles. &ldquo;Write the person&rsquo;s name on it, and you&rsquo;ll have something to remember them by during Christmas.&rdquo; Though the merry tone of the celebrations had been interrupted by this fairly sad activity, many students were glad to participate. Phoebe grabbed a candle of her own and wrote her parents&rsquo; names on it. She smiles sadly and lights the wick. A warm glow emitted from the small flame. Suddenly, she has a realization, and she looks towards Andrew. He still refused to join in. </span><span class="c4 c16">Out of all the activities, he could have done this one, right?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;She grabs another candle and lights the flame. She slowly walks over to Andrew and holds it out to him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to write your sister&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; He looks away in anguish. &ldquo;No...get that away from me&hellip;&rdquo; Phoebe didn&rsquo;t back down, clearly not understanding his discomfort. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a memento.&rdquo; She holds it towards him still, and he whimpers. &ldquo;Stop...I don&rsquo;t want to do it.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is it with you?&rdquo; Andrew couldn&rsquo;t hold it any longer. His pyrophobia was setting off alarm bells in every part of his brain. &ldquo;Leave me alone! I can&rsquo;t bear to see another fire!&rdquo; He pushes her back, and she stumbles, the candle falling from her hands. Flames began to spread onto the decorations, and several frightened students huddled into a corner. The fire became larger and larger as smoke started to fill the room. Andrew&rsquo;s eyes were wide, he was frozen in fear. No one dared to move; they were too scared to get the fire extinguisher. The memory of his sister&rsquo;s death was coming back to Andrew, and he couldn&rsquo;t watch anymore. He ran out into the flames, as students called for him to back up. &ldquo;Andrew! What are you doing?!&rdquo; He slides under the teacher&rsquo;s desk and grabs the fire extinguisher. He goes to put out the fire, but the thing just didn&rsquo;t work. Eventually, he got it to spray, but the flames were high now. He braces for impact, when suddenly a bright light reaches his eyes. Immediately, all of the flames dissipated. When the smoke cleared, the figure of Agatha came into view, and she was still in her angelic form. The other students and Mrs. Thee stood in shock and amazement at the sight of her. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s an angel&hellip;&rdquo; Andrew dropped the fire extinguisher and closed his eyes. &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you leave me alone?&rdquo; Agatha places a hand on his shoulder, and forces him to open his eyes. &ldquo;I made a promise to God that I would help you, and I don&rsquo;t intend to break it.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you told God! I just want to be alone. Just let me be&hellip;&rdquo; Agatha grabs him by the collar with an angry expression. Her angelic form turns dark and cold. &ldquo;I MAY BE AN ANGEL, BUT THAT DOESN&rsquo;T MEAN I CAN&rsquo;T FORCE YOU TO LISTEN TO ME! NOW SHUT UP AND LISTEN!&rdquo; Andrew&rsquo;s face was full of fear. &ldquo;I get it, I get it! Please don&rsquo;t hurt me&hellip;&rdquo; She drops him, and her angelic form returns. &ldquo;You have 19 days. If you don&rsquo;t bring back our spirit by that time, you&rsquo;ll be nothing. A shell of a person. I didn&rsquo;t want to have to do this, but...it&rsquo;s the only way.&rdquo; Andrew starts to feel light in his hands and he looks down to see that his left hand was now transparent. His sister starts to fade away. &ldquo;Wait! Aggy, I...I can&rsquo;t do it without you&hellip;&rdquo; Agatha looks back at him sadly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dead, brother. Now&rsquo;s the time for you to do things on your own.&rdquo; She disappears into thin air, leaving Andrew to stand quietly. The other students were all looking at him, the feeling of awe still lingering in their faces. He walks over and picks up the knocked over candle. He places it on his desk, and lights it, watching the flame slowly move back and forth. He grabs a marker and writes Agatha&rsquo;s name on the front. After a few minutes, he turned around and faced the students. &ldquo;Well? Are we just going to leave the decorations on the ground?&rdquo; Their faces all lit up, and Phoebe smiles, a tear falling down her cheek. Following this, the students remade all of their Christmas decorations, with help from Andrew. His skill at design made them all impressed, and Phoebe was starting to realize why he was considered the best at decorating in the past. It had been years since Andrew was this happy. In fact, the celebrating which was just happening in the classroom began to spread throughout the whole school. Word got out across the town that Andrew had finally got his spirit back. The school board was so impressed that they allowed him to decorate the entire building. Him and Phoebe were putting garland on the outside of the school one day, specifically December 16th, when he decided to finally talk to her again. &ldquo;Hey, uh, Phobe?&rdquo; &ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; &ldquo;I wanted to say that...I&rsquo;m sorry for what happened in the cemetery the other day&hellip;&rdquo; She smiles. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine...I understand what you&rsquo;re going through. I&rsquo;m sorry as well. I know I said some horrible things, too.&rdquo; Andrew stared at her for several minutes and then looked to the ground. &ldquo;What? Something wrong?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s nothing&hellip;&rdquo; Actually, it wasn&rsquo;t nothing at all. Andrew was beginning to feel odd in his chest. Right now, all he was thinking about was the fact that he never realized how attractive Phoebe was. He hadn&rsquo;t noticed her beautiful light brown hair and freckles before this. He tried to push the thought out of his mind. He was supposed to be avoiding this sort of thing. His sister was the one for him, not some other girl he didn&rsquo;t know. He returns to decorating. It was quiet for several minutes. Suddenly, Phoebe broke the silence as Andrew was putting lights on the garland. &ldquo;Hey, Andrew...um...if you want, I could come over and...help you decorate your house&hellip;&rdquo; Andrew&rsquo;s eyes went wide and then he shook his head. &ldquo;No...I&rsquo;ll do it myself...I don&rsquo;t need your help&hellip;&rdquo; Phoebe glances at him and frowns. &ldquo;I see&hellip;&rdquo; They continued their work in silence once again, when all of sudden, the lights in Andrew&rsquo;s hands fell straight through. He goes to pick them up, but his hands seem to be non-existent. Andrew starts to feel angry. &ldquo;But I did everything you asked!&rdquo; He runs off in anger as Phoebe stands with a worried expression. &ldquo;Andrew...&rdquo; He kept running and running, eventually ending up in the middle of a park seating area. He sits down on the water fountain edge and sighs. Suddenly, he felt an angelic presence and slammed his fist down. &ldquo;Why am I still turning? You said I need to find the spirit! Isn&rsquo;t that what I did?&rdquo; Agatha places a glowing hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;You still refuse to find someone else.&rdquo; &ldquo;Someone else- how can I do such a thing? I love you! I can&rsquo;t just-&rdquo; She covers his mouth. &ldquo;You have someone new right in front of you. She shares many things with you, and yet&hellip;&rdquo; Agatha sighs. She pulls out a piece of mistletoe and hands it to him. He finds that his right hand is full again and he takes the mistletoe. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t think I can let you go&hellip;&rdquo; Agatha frowns. &ldquo;I appreciate the fact that you still care about me, but...you have to move on. I&rsquo;m sorry...that&rsquo;s my final word.&rdquo; She fades away once again. Andrew looks down at the mistletoe. &ldquo;Alright. You win&hellip;&rdquo; He walks silently out of the park and heads for Phoebe&rsquo;s house. He knocks twice, and she answers after a few minutes. &ldquo;Andrew?&rdquo; He looks to the ground. &ldquo;Can I talk with you?&rdquo; Phoebe smiles. &ldquo;Of course&hellip;&rdquo; She grabs her jacket and comes outside. They sit down on her house&rsquo;s front steps. &ldquo;So...what did you want to talk about?&rdquo; Andrew looks to the ground. &ldquo;Are you really like me?&rdquo; Phoebe stares at him for a few minutes and then nods silently. &ldquo;It was 2 years ago. My parents were stationed in the military and I was in the care of a friend. Though time passed, they still hadn&rsquo;t come back. Eventually I learned they died in an ambush. I had to spend Christmas alone, and I was forced to live with my uncle. He&rsquo;s nothing like my parents. He&rsquo;s vile and I wish I could just run away&hellip;&rdquo; A tear rolls down her cheek. Andrew looks to the ground. &ldquo;At least you didn&rsquo;t have to live with guilt&hellip;&rdquo; Phoebe stares at him. &ldquo;You still blame yourself for what happened?&rdquo; He nods silently. &ldquo;Who else is there to blame?&rdquo; She eyes him with an expression full of pity and places her hand upon his shoulder. &ldquo;Life has a way of making choices for us. You think I chose to lose my parents? You think I wanted to be with my uncle? Of course not. But that&rsquo;s what happened, and I had to cope with it.&rdquo; He looks to the ground sadly. &ldquo;But I promised I would be there for her&hellip;&rdquo; She doesn&rsquo;t look at him, but sighs. &ldquo;Some promises...can&rsquo;t be kept&hellip;&rdquo; He glares at her. &ldquo;How would you know?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well...my parents made many promises to me throughout my childhood, and most of them never came true. Before my parents went away to the military...they promised that they would come back and we would finally spend a normal Christmas together. That promise will never be fulfilled.&rdquo; Andrew starts to feel ashamed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry...that was wrong of me to say&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t apologize...I know it can be hard to lose someone...I lost two important people in my life. I find that the best way to deal with such things is to not think about it. Surely you must long to forget the tragedy that claimed your sister? All you have to do is think about the things that matter.&rdquo; She smiles and grabs his hand. He stares at her in awe for several minutes. Suddenly, her uncle called from inside. &ldquo;Phoebe, it&rsquo;s getting late. Get your ass back inside!&rdquo; &ldquo;Coming uncle&hellip;&rdquo; She heads for the door, but not before waving with a gentle smile. When she was gone, Andrew held his heart and looked to the sky. Snow was starting to fall again, as he started to think to himself. </span><span class="c4 c16">Is it really so easy to move on?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.tuy7iymt6fz1"><span class="c20 c17">IV</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c4">In her medium sized bedroom, Phoebe had a small desk which was tightly shoved next to a twin bed. On this particular day of December 20th, 1989, a Sony Walkman played several holiday tunes from her childhood, as she sat at the aforementioned desk, folding paper crafts. She had always been good at these sorts of things, and so she wanted to give Andrew some sort of special Christmas gift that came from her heart. She grabs a sheet of red paper from a scattered pile of various other papers and prepares to cut it with scissors. However, midway through cutting, she stops, shakes her head, and then crumbles the piece up into a ball which she throws behind her. She reaches to the floor again, this time pulling out gold and white paper. She proceeds with her cutting, eventually ending up with evenly squared pieces which she folds into flowers. She was about to admire her handiwork, when the lights suddenly went out. She sat there, startled, for several minutes, as the music from the Walkman continued to play. Breaking the peace, her uncle yells from downstairs. &ldquo;Phoebe, what did you do?!&rdquo; &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t me, uncle!&rdquo; She hears the sound of shuffling, and the front door slamming shut. After a few minutes, her uncle came storming back inside, and burst into her room. &ldquo;Uncle, what-&rdquo; He gets close to her with an angry expression. &ldquo;I was ok with this decorating shit at first, but now it&rsquo;s getting out of hand!&rdquo; &ldquo;I just wanted to celebrate for once&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Well celebrate some other way! I&rsquo;m tearing all of this shit down and you better not intervene!&rdquo; He heads for the stairs, and Phoebe desperately goes after him. &ldquo;Wait, you don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; &ldquo;I told not to intervene.&rdquo; He opened the front door and Phoebe followed, grabbing his hand. &ldquo;STOP IT!&rdquo; Her uncle stopped in his tracks, and she began to feel nervous. &ldquo;Uncle, I just want to be happy...is that too much to ask?&rdquo; His expression began to get angrier and angrier, to the point where Phoebe let go of his hand and backed up. He grabs her by the collar and throws her into the brick wall behind them. She tries to recover and groans, but then her uncle takes her hand and throws her into the snow. He approaches, rage in eyes, and goes to inflict more abuse. &ldquo;Wait..no...stop, uncle&hellip;&rdquo; He grabs her by the neck and she gasps for air. It seemed to be a hopeless situation, when suddenly, a voice called out from behind them. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; They turned around and saw Andrew standing there with concern all over his face</span><span class="c26">. </span><span class="c4">&ldquo;Scram! This is none of your business.&rdquo; Andrew walks a little closer and studies the situation. &ldquo;Well, I think it&rsquo;s my business, now. Surely you would prefer I were to keep quiet? Or should I freely walk away and tell the police of this abusive situation?&rdquo; Phoebe&rsquo;s uncle grunts, drops her, and heads back inside, slamming the door behind him. Andrew holds out his hand. &ldquo;You alright?&rdquo; Phoebe takes his hand and smiles wearily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just the same as I always am.&rdquo; They sit down on the steps, and Andrew eyes the house worriedly. &ldquo;Your uncle...is he always like that?&rdquo; She holds her head down. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Andrew stares at her with pity. &ldquo;I never knew you had all of this going on&hellip;&rdquo; She frowns. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fret...I&rsquo;m used to it by now&hellip;but let&rsquo;s talk about something else. What&rsquo;s going on? Why did you come over here?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well...I guess I just needed someone to talk to, and...there was something I wanted to ask you about.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hm? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Andrew looks to the ground. &ldquo;Um...have you ever felt like you wanted to do something, but another part of you says not to, despite the fact that you desperately want to do that thing?&rdquo; Phoebe&rsquo;s eyes go wide. &ldquo;I feel that way all the time&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Wait, really? How so?&rdquo; &ldquo;My uncle...ever since I came to live with him, I&rsquo;ve felt like running away, making my own path...but a part of me says that I shouldn&rsquo;t, &lsquo;cause...I&rsquo;d have nowhere else to go.&rdquo; It was quiet for a few minutes. &ldquo;I see...my feeling is different...the truth is, I...like you, but...my heart says I should only love my sister&hellip;&rdquo; Phoebe&rsquo;s cheeks went red. &ldquo;Ehm, well...isn&rsquo;t the heart supposed to be a place of love for everyone? Why should you only love your sister? I mean...the relationship you and her had was not necessarily...right, by society&rsquo;s standards...&rdquo; &ldquo;I know, but...when the big red thing in my chest says I should love my sister only, and my brain says I should move on...I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo; Phoebe looks to the side, sneakily trying to hide her glee from his earlier confession. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying that it&rsquo;s good that you like me instead of your sister, but...you know, I like you, too&hellip;&rdquo; They sat there in silence for a while, no one daring to speak and risk making the conversation even more awkward. Suddenly, in that tense moment, Andrew grabbed Phoebe&rsquo;s hand and his face turned red. Phoebe&rsquo;s eyes went wide again. But despite their reactions, they didn&rsquo;t want to look at each other. After a few minutes, Phoebe finally decided to face Andrew once again, but she finds that he also had the same thought. &ldquo;So...you feel the same way&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah...I guess so...&rdquo; They stared at each other for a moment, and then, with agreement silently happening in their heads, they kissed slowly and softly. It was quiet as they enjoyed their personal experience. They eventually released each other with a feeling of reluctance. Phoebe looked to the ground. &ldquo;I...I never thought a kiss would be so&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Sexual?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, exactly!&rdquo; They laugh, when suddenly, the front door opens and Phoebe&rsquo;s uncle snatches her away. &ldquo;I think you two have talked for long enough.&rdquo; &ldquo;Uncle, please&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;No. I just got a call from my hookups, and they just put you back on the agreement.&rdquo; Phoebe&rsquo;s eyes go wide with fear and dread. &ldquo;B-but...uncle, I said I didn&rsquo;t want to do that anymore&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your choice, now get your ass inside or there&rsquo;ll be a massive whooping coming your way.&rdquo; Phoebe frowns. &ldquo;Okay...bye Andrew&hellip;&rdquo; She waves sadly as the door closes. Andrew stood scratching his head. </span><span class="c4 c16">An agreement? She didn&rsquo;t mention anything about that.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;He walks off, still thinking about Phoebe, their wonderful kiss, and the agreement she apparently had with her uncle. </span><span class="c4 c16">What did it all mean?</span><span class="c4">, he wondered. About 2 days later, Phoebe sat in her bedroom, shaking. &ldquo;Phoebe, get down here! We need to talk.&rdquo; She was dreading the moment this would happen. Her uncle said things would go this way. She slowly walks out of her bedroom and down the stairs. Her uncle sat in the living room waiting for her. He spoke, but didn&rsquo;t look in her direction. &ldquo;Strip.&rdquo; Phoebe took a step backwards, shocked beyond all belief. &ldquo;What?!&rdquo; &ldquo;You heard what I said.&rdquo; &ldquo;Uncle, I...I don&rsquo;t need the money anymore...I don&rsquo;t want to have to do this&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Listen, girl. You&rsquo;ve kept me out of payment for quite a while now, and I&rsquo;m starting to tire of it. The last time you did it no questions asked.&rdquo; &ldquo;But it was still embarrassing! Don&rsquo;t you think about the fact that this is child pedophilia?&rdquo; &ldquo;Eh, if it gets me more bills, I don&rsquo;t care. Plus it gives me a nice show, too.&rdquo; Phoebe cringes inside. &ldquo;Ugh...that&rsquo;s so disgusting&hellip;&rdquo; Her uncle sighs. &ldquo;You still haven&rsquo;t stripped.&rdquo; Phoebe looks to the ground. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to do it.&rdquo; For the first time in the conversation, he turns to face her and glares. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you talk back to me!&rdquo; He stands up and grabs her by the collar, shoving her to the floor where she winces. Tears start to fall down her face. &ldquo;No! Stop it!&rdquo; He starts removing her clothes as she struggles to break free of his grasp. When he eventually got everything off (excluding panties), he took out his phone. &ldquo;Now make a nice pose like this before we get under there.&rdquo; Through tears, Phoebe reluctantly follows his instructions. &ldquo;Ah, nice. Now let&rsquo;s get some close ups&hellip;&rdquo; He goes to take off her panties and she pushes back against his advances. &ldquo;No! Let me go&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Why? So you can run to your precious little boyfriend? Imagine how he would feel if he knew about this...&rdquo; At this statement, Phoebe finally regained her strength, and she punched him in the face. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you make assumptions about him!&rdquo; She runs off and hides in her bedroom, where she locks the door and holds herself. She starts crying again and holds her head down. Phoebe eventually redressed, though the tears continued to come. Meanwhile, Andrew was walking up to the front door, two movie tickets in his hand. He knocked twice, waiting for a response, but none came. He knocks again, but this time someone yells from inside: &ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; He eyes the living room incredulously, and prepares to walk away, when he notices Phoebe&rsquo;s bedroom window. He thinks for a moment. &ldquo;Eh...it&rsquo;s worth a shot...&rdquo; He heads around to the side of the house, where there was another window, and he scoops a pile of snow into his hand. Calculating the proper angle, he throws the newly made snowball at her window. From inside, Phoebe hears a loud thud, which snaps her away from her sad moping. She goes to open the window and a smile creeps onto her face when she sees Andrew. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well...I was wondering if you wanted to go see a movie&hellip;&rdquo; He holds up the tickets for her to see. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s such a good idea right now&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; &ldquo;Um...I&rsquo;ll come down and tell you.&rdquo; She grabs her jacket, puts on her shoes, and then faces the window. &ldquo;Be prepared to catch me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wait, wha-&rdquo; She steps out and slides down the roof, landing in Andrew&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;That was dangerous&hellip;&rdquo; Phoebe shrugs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m used to my life being at risk...&rdquo; Andrew eyes her worriedly. They sit down on the steps again. &ldquo;Um, so what was it you wanted to tell me about?&rdquo; Phoebe sighs. &ldquo;You know how I said my uncle is abusive&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well...that&rsquo;s not the only thing he does&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying...my uncle is a pedophile.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wait...what does he do to you? Does he sexually assault you? Does he force himself on-&rdquo; Phoebe puts a finger up to his mouth. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t do that...but...he forces me to strip naked and then he...takes pictures which he gives to his friends for money.&rdquo; &ldquo;You...you can&rsquo;t fight back?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well...when he first made me do it, he promised I would get some of the money, but...now I hate it when he strips me with his poisonous eyes...he stripped me a few minutes ago&hellip;&rdquo; Andrew&rsquo;s eyes went wide and he hugged Phoebe tightly, whose eyes also went wide. &ldquo;I...is there something I can do?&rdquo; Phoebe holds him and begins to cry again. &ldquo;You being here is something.&rdquo; They sat there hugging for several minutes, when the front door suddenly opened. They turned around in surprise, and saw Phoebe&rsquo;s uncle standing with a rifle in hand. &ldquo;Why is he here?!&rdquo; He cocks the gun. &ldquo;You have 30 seconds to leave, or else you&rsquo;re dead.&rdquo; Phoebe stands in front of him. &ldquo;If you plan to kill him, then you have to kill me.&rdquo; He smirks. &ldquo;Fine, then.&rdquo; Phoebe&rsquo;s eyes go wide. Andrew grabs her hand. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here!&rdquo; &ldquo;Woah!&rdquo; They ran towards Andrew&rsquo;s house and Phoebe&rsquo;s uncle followed. Bullets came flying from behind them, but they narrowly missed. Eventually, they made it far outside the neighborhood, even past Andrew&rsquo;s house, and then they stumbled right off of the edge of a small hill, tumbling downwards into a pile of snow. &ldquo;Ow...You good, Phoebe? Phoebe? Hey where are you?&rdquo; Phoebe appears from under the snow and brushes off her hair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here, I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh...thank goodness.&rdquo; He makes his way over to her. &ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; &ldquo;</span><span class="c4">No idea</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo; &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ve gotten ourselves into a pretty bad situation&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Bad? This is the most fun I&rsquo;ve had in years!&rdquo; Phoebe laughs and grabs Andrew by the head, kissing him on the lips. They sat there kissing and laughing for several minutes. Suddenly, they heard a rumbling sound, and Phoebe&rsquo;s uncle came storming down the hill on an electric snow-sled. &ldquo;Woah!&rdquo; &ldquo;Run!&rdquo; They ran through the thick snow, not stopping to look back once. After running quite a distance, they ended up at a frozen lake. Phoebe&rsquo;s uncle dismounts the sled and readies his rifle. Andrew and Phoebe carefully step backwards onto the lake, causing cracks to appear. As they went backwards, Phoebe&rsquo;s uncle went forward. Eventually, they made it to the other side. Phoebe eyes the ground below them nervously. Her uncle smirks. &ldquo;End of the line.&rdquo; He steps forwards, and the ice under his feet breaks, sending him into the icy cold water below. Phoebe and Andrew stare at the broken hole for a moment, and then head into the woods behind them. Past the trees, they came upon a massive body of water, which wasn&rsquo;t frozen at all, and sticking out into that water was a small pier. Andrew&rsquo;s eyes suddenly went wide. &ldquo;Wait...I remember this place&hellip;&rdquo; He goes onto the pier and sits down at the edge. Sudden feelings were coming back to him. Phoebe sat down next to him and grabbed his hand. She stares at him, trying to deduce his feelings. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; &ldquo;This pier...me and my sister once sat right here...we made a promise to each other...that when things got rough, or if things were truly dreary...then we would be there for one another&hellip;&rdquo; Phoebe looks at him wistfully. &ldquo;So when you said...you promised you would be there for her...that&rsquo;s what you meant?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah. We were serious about it...that&rsquo;s why I carry so much guilt.&rdquo; Phoebe smiles. &ldquo;Then...I promise to be there for you...in moments when you think of your sister...and in moments when you feel the saddest...&rdquo; Andrew stares at her, taking in every word she just said. After a few minutes, he starts to stare out into the distance. &ldquo;And I...promise to be there for you...whenever you&rsquo;re in need of family...I&rsquo;ll be your family...and when you miss your parents the most...I&rsquo;ll be there to console you&hellip;&rdquo; Phoebe smiles, tears falling down her face. They hug tightly and as they do, Andrew starts to realize something. &ldquo;Wait...my body&hellip;&rdquo; He studies his hands. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s back to normal?&rdquo; Phoebe studies his hand. &ldquo;You found a way to move on.&rdquo; Andrew smiles. Suddenly, a bright light appears in front of them, and Agatha comes into view. She smiles. &ldquo;You did it, brother.&rdquo; Andrew looks at her sheepishly. &ldquo;Well...it&rsquo;s thanks to you and Phoebe.&rdquo; Agatha frowns. &ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; A tear falls down her cheek. Andrew stares at her with confusion. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; She doesn&rsquo;t look at him. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how much I miss you, brother&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Huh...but you wanted </span><span class="c4 c16">me</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;to move on&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;You still have a life to live, while I...I&rsquo;m just an angel who can only watch with longing. If anyone needs to move on, it&rsquo;s me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sis...is this goodbye?&rdquo; She looks to the ground. &ldquo;Well...unless God asks something else of me...then yes&hellip;&rdquo; Andrew&rsquo;s eyes go wide, and tears start to well up. He hugs her tightly and she hugs him back, tears falling down her face as well. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss you&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss you, too.&rdquo; They smile, before letting go of each other. Agatha turns to Phoebe. &ldquo;Thank you for everything.&rdquo; She smiles. &ldquo;Of course...oh, and Dara still thinks about you...if you remember her&hellip;&rdquo; Agatha&rsquo;s eyes go wide. &ldquo;Dara...oh that poor girl...please tell her that I appreciate the sentiment.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will.&rdquo; Agatha nods and faces them both one last time. &ldquo;Goodbye, brother. Goodbye, Phoebe.&rdquo; She waves and they wave back. She smiles sadly at Andrew and murmurs: &ldquo;I still love you, you know&hellip;&rdquo; Then she fades away, leaving behind a trail of white doves. Andrew and Phoebe glance at each other and head back to the frozen lake. They go up the hill hand in hand. Following this, Phoebe and Andrew spent the rest of the holidays together, and they officially accepted that they were dating. A day before Christmas, they went over to Dara&rsquo;s house, which Andrew remembered the address of, and talked to her about Agatha. &ldquo;So she came to you as an angel?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah. She&rsquo;s just as pretty as ever.&rdquo; Dara smiles. &ldquo;Did you ask her about me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Of course. She said she appreciates the fact that you remember her.&rdquo; Dara looks to the ground, her smile shrinking in width. &ldquo;Did one of you send this?&rdquo; She holds up a small unmarked box. &ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo; &ldquo;Hm...well it just appeared on my doorstep before you two got here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Maybe you should open it.&rdquo; &ldquo;I guess it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt&hellip;&rdquo; She gets some scissors and opens the box carefully. Her eyes go wide. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be&hellip;&rdquo; She pulls out a beautiful jewel necklace, and Andrew&rsquo;s eyes go wide as well. &ldquo;That kind of necklace is so hard to come by...how did one end up here?&rdquo; Phoebe walks over and looks at the peculiar item with interest. &ldquo;You think...maybe Agatha sent it?&rdquo; Andrew looks to the ground and then smiles. &ldquo;That would be something she would do. But why that type of necklace?&rdquo; Dara sighs. &ldquo;I know why...a few years ago, me and Agatha went out shopping and I saw this very piece in an expensive jewelry store. I was eager to own it, but my funds were low. I can&rsquo;t believe she would actually get it for me...&rdquo; Andrew and Phoebe stared at her for several minutes. &ldquo;Say...why don&rsquo;t you spend Christmas with us?&rdquo; Dara smiles and puts the necklace around her neck. &ldquo;I think I would like that.&rdquo; And so, the three of them spent Christmas together along with Andrew and Dara&rsquo;s parents. They had a grand party at the house on the hill, and every year since, Andrew and Phoebe continued the tradition of decorating. From Heaven, Agatha looked down with a smile on her face, though she still felt a little sad. From time to time, Andrew would look up and their eyes would meet, though he physically wouldn&rsquo;t know it. However, he could always feel it. He knew deep down that she could see him, and so he always took time to look towards her, to give Agatha a sense of happiness. Some days, Phoebe would look with him and they both would give her joy. Though Andrew now found a way to move on, he never once forgot everything his sister did for him. He would always remember their memories, and that was the most important part. </span></p><div><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p></div></body></html>
