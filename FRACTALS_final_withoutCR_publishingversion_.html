class="c18 c11">-Preface-</span></h4><p class="c28"><span class="c7">This story is heavily inspired by the 1844 Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale </span><span class="c7 c17">The Snow Queen</span><span class="c7">. My intent when writing this was to make a more narrative-focused version of the original novel, as I felt there were parts of it that felt unnecessary or not connected. The biggest task I set to achieve with my writing was the fleshing out of the Snow Queen herself. While the original fairy tale is named after the antagonistic character, she hardly appears after her introduction, and doesn&rsquo;t interact with anyone once Gerda reaches her castle. I wanted to make a more formidable snow queen. My story is also entirely original in its characterization and relationships, as it was not my goal to replace the original or claim that my version is superior. I have simply made a new story based on the characters and the world from Hans Christian Andersen&rsquo;s fairy tale. </span></p><h4 class="c33" id="h.a1ugzklch4u8"><span class="c18 c34">-Plot Synopsis-</span></h4><p class="c37"><span class="c0">14 year olds Greta and Kaye have been childhood friends for as long as they can remember.

A world of fantasy and magic. Monsters and knights. Kings and queens. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And in a faraway part of this land, a village sat at the bottom of a rocky hill. This village contained no people, no this was a goblin village. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The goblins were a foul species, they sought no companionship with others, their only allies were themselves. It was common for goblins to value the people of the village they live in, meaning outsiders were not tolerated or liked in any way. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At this very moment, an outsider was walking through the gates of this village. She was not a goblin, but to call her human would be blasphemous. No, she was like a god, but more a demon. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her hair was white like snow, her skin was pale, but glowed in the midday sun. Her footsteps were light and made no impression. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was why the guards of the village only noticed her after several minutes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before the mysterious young woman could utter another breath, a flurry of arrows came flying at her, with speed that a normal person couldn&rsquo;t compete with. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But this young woman was no mere human. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With inhuman reflexes, the young woman pulled out two ornate swords and struck all of the arrows down like it was nothing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, goblins ran out from various directions, wielding large swords. The young woman grins. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A large battle ensues, though it would probably be more accurate to describe it as a slaughter. The goblins stood no chance against this outsider, she killed all of them without even flinching or stopping to look. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Once she was done with all of the soldiers that came her way, she then made her way to every house and slaughtered every goblin she saw, no matter if it was a female, male, or even child. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After an hour, the village was quiet, an eerie aura in the air. The mysterious woman took no time to observe this, however. She simply continued on her way, stopping just outside a large black castle on the edge of a cliff that overlooked the village.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Impressive&hellip;&rdquo; The construction of the castle was infinitely more well rounded than the other buildings in the village. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The goblins that lived here were older and more intelligent than the goblins in the village, so naturally they protected themselves in a smarter way. Being secluded, they also built many things for their own use and amusement. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But the mysterious young woman who stood outside their doors didn&rsquo;t care about that. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She sliced through the giant wooden doors blocking her way and stepped into the grand hall of the goblins. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There, she saw her prize. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the middle of the hall was an ornate mirror, adorned with diamonds and crystals. The mysterious woman cared nothing for their construction, however. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The goblins, smart as they are, saw the woman and something seemed to click in their minds. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;the Snow Queen!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yes, this young woman was known by many as &ldquo;the Snow Queen&rdquo;, a feared figure throughout the land. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The goblins knew her, but figured that maybe she wanted to request their help. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you here to request our assistance? I assure you that our weapons making skills are unmatched by many&mdash;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The goblin king couldn&rsquo;t finish his statement, as the queen sliced his neck clean open. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She didn&rsquo;t want their help, nor their weapons. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The other goblins run for the exit in fear, but the queen kills all of them without effort. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Having succeeded in killing all of the goblins in the village, the queen approaches her prize: the mirror. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was beautifully made, the queen rubbed her fingers along its surface, marveling at the craftsmanship. But she didn&rsquo;t care for the mirror at all, she only wanted what it contained. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">With a swipe of her sword, the mirror shattered into millions of small pieces. The snow queen collected the pieces into a jar and then strode off, satisfied with her task. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.ac1aaqhwjgud"><span class="c16"></span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><h3 class="c19" id="h.6z3xop9maa36"><span class="c16">I: Her Lovely Singing Voice</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you were to ask a guy what he devotes most of his dedication towards, what would his answer be? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Probably girls. The hair, the scent, the lovely demeanor. You can&rsquo;t go wrong with girls. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Every guy (presumably) would give up everything if it means getting with a nice girl. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">15 year old Kaye was one such guy. He has a lovely friend named Greta, and she was one of the nicest, purest girls you could ever hope to meet. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her eyes were like purple jewels, and her hair was golden like the purest honey. She wasn&rsquo;t the most beautiful girl in the world, there were plenty others who might be more fit for that title, but she was cute in her own right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But even with her looks, which Kaye found wonderful, there was something above it all that made Greta simply the best girl: her singing voice. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta loved to sing, but she only really did it in private due to embarrassment. Kaye has asked her several times to sing for him, but she never relents. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He has to settle for secretly listening behind Greta&rsquo;s back. She has a beautiful voice, not musician level, but also nice and calm in a way that makes Kaye&rsquo;s heart soften every time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As far as Kaye was concerned, he would do anything to protect that wonderful voice. But even if Greta wasn&rsquo;t a good singer, Kaye would undoubtedly be by her side in a heartbeat. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the years that Kaye had known her, Greta had always been very fragile and emotionally vulnerable. There were many tragic events in the past that caused great distress within her, and so Kaye felt obligated to keep her steady. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Probably the worst event in Greta&rsquo;s life was the death of her dear mother. Greta always loved her mother, they were an unbreakable pair, and more than just relatives, they were friends. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But life works in cruel ways. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">One fateful year, a rapid epidemic spread throughout Kaye and Greta&rsquo;s village, killing many in its path. Greta&rsquo;s mother was one such victim. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her death hit hard, not just for Greta, but for the entire village as a whole. Greta&rsquo;s mother was just that influential and beloved. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Unfortunately, there was very little that Kaye could do for his dear friend. He sought to comfort her, but also felt woefully unqualified to do so. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">After all, what had </span><span class="c7 c17">he</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;lost? His parents were still alive. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye decided it would be better to say nothing, rather than potentially hurting her with his words. He ended up regretting this decision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The day of Greta&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s funeral, Kaye found his entire life crumbling into pieces. He would never forget the crushing sight of Greta, staring dead-eyed at her mother&rsquo;s coffin. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Such features never belonged on the girl&rsquo;s face, and yet&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye had let it happen. He blamed himself. He hated himself. He considered himself an idiot for letting things be this way. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c20">All this time, he had ignored Greta&rsquo;s pain, worrying for basically no reason, letting her cry, suffer, be miserable, and for what? Saving his own pride? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye declared that he would never let Greta feel that sad ever again. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Two days after the funeral, he approached his depressed friend. She had been sitting at her bedroom window for hours since her mother&rsquo;s death, and no one could get her to do anything different. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye slowly approached her slumped figure and got on his knees, placing a hand on her shoulder. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Greta.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He whispers. No response. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Greta, look at me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye pleads, reaching out and turning her head towards him. He gasps. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&rsquo;s eyes&hellip;they were red with tears. Dried tracks lined her face, and a seemingly unbreakable frown was etched across her once exuberant features. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Have you been eating, Greta?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye asks worriedly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta says nothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, she forcefully wraps her arms around Kaye, moaning woefully. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Greta&hellip;I hate to see you like this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye admits. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I want to take you somewhere, is that okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta pauses for a second and then nods slowly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye smiles and then grabs Greta by the hand. He leads her outside and they quietly walk through town. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She immediately starts to cower under the words of the townsfolk, who loudly talk with comments of pity. Kaye squeezes her hand and takes her forward. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta looks up at him and slightly smiles, before it disappears instantly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After a few minutes of walking, they finally arrive at their destination. Greta gasps at what she sees. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A massive monument had been erected atop a grassy hill outside the village. Flowers, gifts, candy, and other offerings had been placed around it, along with thousands of kind letters. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tears started to fall from Greta&rsquo;s eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;T-this&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye smiles at her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Everyone loved your mother, Greta. There are others here who share your pain and sadness. I brought you here because I wanted you to understand that. You are not alone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta held a hand over her mouth as tears continued to fall. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;T-thank you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye nods. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. But Greta&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye pulls her into a hug. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I think your mother would have wanted you to smile. It&rsquo;s okay to cry, but it&rsquo;s better to be happy for the life she lived, than sad for what you miss.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&rsquo;s eyes go wide. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&hellip;it might take me a while to be happy again&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She admits. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye places a hand on the top of her head and rubs her hair softly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;ll be here to help you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta looks up at him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Y-you&rsquo;ll be here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye nods. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta looks to the ground, and then buries her face in Kaye&rsquo;s shirt. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do our best&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She mutters. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye chuckles. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So began the days of Greta&rsquo;s recuperation. Kaye did the best he could to cheer Greta up, even if that pushed his own limits. He took Greta on all sorts of adventures in town, showed her interesting things, and bought her cool trinkets. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Eventually, Greta was starting to smile again. Kaye was happy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And yet&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Not one of those smiles seemed genuine. The poor girl was still hurt inside. No matter what Kaye did, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fill the hole left by her mother&rsquo;s death.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But Kaye didn&rsquo;t stop trying. He played with her, joked with her, and encouraged her, for as long as necessary. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta was still sad, but her smiles were becoming more natural again, and she cried less. Then after that, she started singing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was when Kaye first fell in love with her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, one bright sunny day, when Kaye and Greta were playing after school, something happened that hadn&rsquo;t happened in a long time:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta smiled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Brightly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Brilliantly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Happily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And she said to her stupefied friend: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thanks for being by my side, Kaye.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye didn&rsquo;t think he had ever seen Greta looking so beautiful until that day. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course, what are friends for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He responded after a few seconds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta giggles and then looks out into the sunny horizon. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a breathtaking sight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, not the sun. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was beautiful, it was like an oil painting, painted with the highest quality oils. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her eyes were painted with a magnificent deep purple, like pristine fine jewels. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her blonde hair was painted like gold, producing a wondrous sheen that was breathtaking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll always be together, won&rsquo;t we Kaye?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta asks. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye smiles and hugs her from behind. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I would never think of leaving your side, not even for the largest diamond.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta looks to the ground with a flush. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I wish we could stay like this forever.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She muses aloud. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So do I&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye whispers to himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The sun then began to set upon the world, and the two returned to their homes. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye knew he would never leave Greta&rsquo;s side. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But what did Greta think about him?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In bed that night, Greta couldn&rsquo;t get Kaye out of her head. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had been with her through the toughest time in her life. He made her laugh, he showed her things she never would have thought of seeing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye wasn&rsquo;t the only one who had fallen in love. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c19" id="h.rue3g9n2716p"><span class="c24">II: His Pearly Blue Eyes</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The town of Wilfonde was the kind of place where if you did something big, everyone would know about it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a quaint little town, situated away from the active areas of the kingdom, but for what they lacked in outside contact, they made up for in inner relations. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Everyone knows each other. If you were someone who just moved in, it would be plainly obvious. Why? Because living in this town requires knowing every single inhabitant by their looks. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You couldn&rsquo;t get by if you didn&rsquo;t. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In a happy corner of town, two houses sat adjacent to each other, connected by a handmade overpass. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This is where lovely Greta and amiable Kaye lived. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A makeshift balcony connected the windows to their bedrooms, giving them ample space to meet up when they wanted to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And they met up often. Today was no exception. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A smiling Greta greeted her friend Kaye in the early morning, sitting next to him in a wooden rocking chair, a tea cup in her hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says with a happy glee about her. Kaye turns to look at her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He says with a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta giggles. Then she starts to hold herself, shaking a little in the morning cold.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip;s-so cold out here&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye takes off his woolen scarf and wraps it around her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is that better?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He asks. Greta hides the flush in her cheeks as she mutters: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes it is. Thank you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye nods in response and looks out into the morning sky once again. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So&hellip;will you sing for me today?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He asks, grinning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta groans. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You always ask this! My answer isn&rsquo;t changing!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye shakes his head in exasperation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is it really that embarrassing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta gulps down her entire tea cup and slams it down on a side table. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Trust me, if I sang for you, you&rsquo;d probably hate the experience.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye sighs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be so hard on yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He says, slightly upset.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, yeah&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta looks to the ground with a blush. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;ve had this conversation before about her singing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye seemed to ask her the same question every single day, but Greta would never relent for as long as she lived.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Why? Because she truly was embarrassed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Most of her songs are about Kaye, so naturally, singing to him would expose everything she wants to hide. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her feelings for Kaye had developed ever since the death of her mother, and yet she could never find the courage to tell him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So have you thought about the future, yet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye suddenly asks, pulling Greta out of her thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks in surprise. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yesterday we talked about the future in class, so I was just curious if you&rsquo;ve thought about it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye explains. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta frowns. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, well&hellip;I haven&rsquo;t really considered anything, yet&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye&rsquo;s eyes go wide, and then he turns away from her awkwardly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, I see&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta tilts her head. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is something wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks curiously. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, the door to the balcony opens, cutting Kaye off. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Greta, Kaye, breakfast is ready.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&rsquo;s father says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll be right down!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta exclaims, surprised. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye looks like he wants to say something else, but decides to leave it for later. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After having a hearty breakfast of bacon and eggs, prepared by Greta&rsquo;s grandmother, Kaye and Greta left for school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Wilfonde school building was located on the opposite side of town, meaning the two friends had to always get up early in order to walk all the way there. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye and Greta didn&rsquo;t have any particular feelings about school, but they consistently had good grades, so it wasn&rsquo;t like they were bored by it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Today&rsquo;s school day went like any other, until the final class, when the teacher decided to ask a certain question. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Has anyone thought about their plans for the future? Having a good career is important for a successful life!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Naturally, there wasn&rsquo;t anyone who raised their hands in response to this question. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, other than Kaye. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, Kaye, so you&rsquo;ve thought ahead. Would you mind telling us what you plan to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye takes a deep breath, noticing that Greta was staring at him with expectant eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Feeling confident, he stands and says: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I want to attend the academy in the capital.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Several gasps filled the room, and Kaye could feel someone glaring daggers at him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big dream, Kaye. I&rsquo;m impressed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The teacher says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Everyone seemed to be in admiration of Kaye for his bold declaration, all except for Greta. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When school was over, and they walked home for the day, the air was tense. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kaye.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta starts sharply.

He couldn&rsquo;t let things end with those horrible comments he said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye walked up the creaky stairs and slipped into Greta&rsquo;s bedroom, taking care not to disturb her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He quietly approaches her bed and stares down at her blanket-covered form. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Greta.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He calls softly.

Where was Kaye? Usually he woke up before her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">Maybe he&rsquo;s still asleep?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta walks over to Kaye&rsquo;s bedroom and peeks through one of his windows. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye wasn&rsquo;t there either. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Greta felt something on her arm. She looked at it but there was only a little bit of water. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then she looks up and sees little white specks of ice falling from the sky. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was snowing!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Snow?&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta heads back to her bedroom and goes downstairs to the kitchen.

I sent him to go buy some eggs since we&rsquo;re out of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Grandmother responds. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta says, feeling sad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you lonely?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Grandmother asks with a glint in her eye. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;G-grandma!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta exclaims, blushing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She runs up to her room and snuggles under the covers. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If it was snowing, it wasn&rsquo;t a school day, so Greta was going to make the most of it by sleeping in. She never liked waking up early. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A few hours passed. Greta had gotten bored of sleeping and was now at her desk, trying her hand at writing song lyrics. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Would Kaye like this song?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta asked aloud. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She glances at the window and gasps. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This wasn&rsquo;t just a bout of snow, this was a full on snowstorm!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A&hellip;storm! Kaye&rsquo;s out there!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta ran down her stairs. She sees her grandma sitting near the fireplace and goes to grab her attention. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Grandma! Grandma! Is Kaye going to be okay? He can&rsquo;t make it in that storm, can he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Grandmother looks at a window nearby and then frowns. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Greta. He may come home, he may not. I think if you pray for him, he might just make it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta doesn&rsquo;t fully believe this, but she doesn&rsquo;t really have a choice, so she sits down in a chair near the fireplace and prays. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c17">Please god&hellip;I don&rsquo;t want to lose someone close to me again. Please bring Kaye back </span><span class="c7 c17">safe</span><span class="c8 c7">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">All Greta could do was hope and pray.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Thump!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A sudden sound breaks Greta from her praying. She walks over to the front door and opens it slowly. She gasps. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kaye!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She exclaims, seeing Kaye laying in the snow a few feet ahead of her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta runs out, Kaye&rsquo;s parents following close behind. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kaye! Kaye!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta calls, rubbing his face through her tears. His skin felt cold, his breathing was ragged. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s bring him inside.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye&rsquo;s mother says, tears also in her eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They lift him up on both sides and carry him inside. A makeshift bed is prepared on the couch, and medical supplies are procured. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For a few hours, Kaye didn&rsquo;t wake. Greta stood by his side the whole day, keeping him warm and comforting him with a few songs she knew. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Greta.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye&rsquo;s father says, handing her a cup of hot tea. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta says with a smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll wake up. Kaye won&rsquo;t die that easily.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye&rsquo;s father says. Greta hopes she can believe his words. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tire </span><span class="c7">yourself watching</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;him. Your health is important as well, Greta.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye&rsquo;s mother says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta nods. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says sadly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Kaye sits up with a groan, startling everyone. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is this? Where am I?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He asks wearily. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kaye!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta exclaims, hugging him forcefully. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was so worried. Don&rsquo;t do that to me, dummy&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says, tears starting to appear in her eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But though this should have been a wonderful moment of cheer and joy, it was short lived. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta noticed something was off about Kaye and looked into his eyes. They were pearly blue, and the emotion they gave off was as cold as ice. It unnerved her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kaye, w-what happened to your eyes?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Kaye roughly pushes Greta away from him, which causes her to fall to the floor. He comes to his feet, standing over her, and exclaims:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Get off of me, you disgusting wench! Who do you think you are?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">The room goes silent. </span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.1km64emu16hf"><span class="c16"></span></h3><h3 class="c5" id="h.z46bls7beh7"><span class="c16"></span></h3><h3 class="c5" id="h.1g2twtkzxnco"><span class="c16"></span></h3><h3 class="c5" id="h.vlr8wxkkx0uc"><span class="c16"></span></h3><h3 class="c5" id="h.l14s5fknf032"><span class="c16"></span></h3><h3 class="c5" id="h.h2ewcnnzfq0l"><span class="c16"></span></h3><h3 class="c5" id="h.1putrz42df19"><span class="c16"></span></h3><h3 class="c5" id="h.a2l3jok75lvb"><span class="c16"></span></h3><h3 class="c5" id="h.nggsu1mcafi"><span class="c16"></span></h3><h3 class="c5" id="h.6utrcdo3guvu"><span class="c16"></span></h3><h3 class="c5" id="h.uxn2vz6ajuy4"><span class="c16"></span></h3><h3 class="c5" id="h.ql8tx4fqlgu"><span class="c16"></span></h3><h3 class="c5" id="h.my5byqpf00qg"><span class="c16"></span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><h3 class="c19" id="h.begt2f7d9nx6"><span class="c16">III: Her Enchanting Sleigh</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In her 16 years of living, Greta came to know a few things. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She knew the sun came up in the morning, and the moon rose in the night. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was aware that time was ongoing, and anything could happen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She had come to terms with the fact that death was inevitable, and sometimes unexpected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She even understood that her world was infinitely smaller than others, and that her selfishness shouldn&#39;t get in the way of what&rsquo;s right. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But the thing Greta knew most of all was that Kaye would never, ever, betray her. Kaye&rsquo;s compassion was a facet she believed was always true, never disputed, she didn&rsquo;t even have doubts about it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kaye&hellip;wouldn&rsquo;t be mean to me, would he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, Kaye was the nicest person Greta had ever met. Why would that change?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Why&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That question was one that Greta had been asking herself for hours since the day Kaye woke up from his snowstorm injuries. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When he uttered the word &ldquo;wench&rdquo;, Greta could not find any words to say. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was frozen the entire day, shocked that her kind friend would ever utter such a horrible word to describe her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A wench? Was Greta really a wench?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What had she done to be called this? Did she deserve it somehow? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No&hellip;that can&rsquo;t be&hellip;I would have known&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta knew she wasn&rsquo;t a wench. She knew she didn&rsquo;t deserve such words. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But why would he say them, then? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta had a weak theory&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is he not my Kaye?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was somewhat plausible. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His demeanor was different. His eyes were pearly blue. How could he even be the same person? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At the same time&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He looks like Kaye, though&hellip;if he isn&rsquo;t Kaye, then where is my real friend?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta looked out her bedroom window with a saddened expression. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where is&hellip;my real friend?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She murmured, putting her head down on the windowsill. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta could still remember the cold look in Kaye&rsquo;s eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She recalled how he degraded her after calling her a wench. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">All she wanted to do was nurse him back to health. But everytime she tried, her will broke further and further.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye was horrible, saying practically any hurtful thing he could think of. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re ugly,&rdquo; he would sneer. &ldquo;I hate seeing you all the time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Greta would tearfully reply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying my best&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This exchange, and similar ones like it, repeated almost every day, and Greta was starting to tire of it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She couldn&rsquo;t look at Kaye without being overcome with emotion. His cold words and vile eyes made her feel like a failure, even though she really wasn&rsquo;t. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">One day, she couldn&#39;t take it anymore, and ran outside despite her grandmother&rsquo;s cries. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She just sat on the doorstep, crying, looking at the sky, remembering how just a few days ago, they had been laughing gaily together. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That boy in the living room, he wasn&rsquo;t Kaye. He just couldn&rsquo;t be. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta turned over in her sleep, unaware of the tears falling from her eyes, partially soaking her bedsheets.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She had cried for her mother when she died, but Kaye had helped her get over it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Now she was back where she started all those years ago, and unfortunately Kaye was too far depraved to help her this time. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta sobbed, and then sat up, her emotions overriding her tiredness. She holds her hands over her face as she cries profusely. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kaye! Why&hellip;?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She screamed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This lasted for several minutes. After a while, Greta had calmed down, but she was still crying a little bit. Wiping her face, Greta gets out of bed and sneaks over to her bedroom window. She opens it and heads out onto the balcony. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She stares up at the night sky, watching the stars. She hoped for a shooting star, but just her luck, none came. Feeling disjointed, Greta then climbs back into her bedroom and goes downstairs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Seeing Kaye sleeping peacefully on the couch, she timidly approaches him and gets on her knees. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kaye&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She whispers softly. He doesn&rsquo;t stir. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta frowns, and then reaches out to touch his hair, rubbing it with enamored fondness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I love you so much, it hurts.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She whispers. Then she leans forward and kisses him gently on the forehead, too scared to go further than that. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Pulling back with a blush, she stares at Kaye&rsquo;s sleeping form with a somber look. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Even if you despise me, or want to get rid of me, I will always love you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta whispers. She gives him one last glance, and then heads back upstairs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The world was awful!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ever since Kaye woke up from his snowstorm-caused slumber, he has been thinking these words. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What a dreadful, ghastly place he was in!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were so many revolting people around him, and they were absolutely obsessive when it came to his health.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you doing better?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They would ask. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you need more heat?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They would offer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kaye, let me know if you want something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A deplorable wretch would say, for hours on end! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was the most annoying one, uttered by a girl that Kaye physically cringed when he tried to look upon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The horrible girl named Greta was his worst nightmare. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She always worried over his health. She consistently offered him things he didn&rsquo;t want. Worst of all, she tried to keep him company!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye wasn&rsquo;t some lonely, miserable person who needed the attention of a cur!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was adamant in voicing these complaints, and yet still&hellip;that terrible girl wouldn&rsquo;t waver. She wouldn&rsquo;t stop! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye was growing tired of her antics. He wanted her out, but unfortunately, his rubbishy parents wouldn&rsquo;t listen. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He just wished he could give them a piece of his mind!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a new day. Apparently, Kaye needed to go to school on this weekday, but that gross slime Greta wouldn&rsquo;t let him. At least she could do something right for once. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But it didn&rsquo;t matter how much he hated the idea of going to some dumb school, because now he was stuck with this wretch, who was so worried about him, she decided to skip school as well!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Disgusting!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye couldn&rsquo;t take it. He didn&rsquo;t want to hang out with her. Not one bit. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Going outside would be better than that. What a brilliant idea!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye left the ghoul behind and went out to play by his lonesome. It was much nicer than being by that cur&rsquo;s side. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What a nuisance!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He cried. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I wish she&rsquo;d just go away already! Whose terrible idea was it to connect my house to hers?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He asks loudly to no one in particular. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, you do deserve some place better than that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Said a melodic faraway voice. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye looked up in wonder. In this place of grossness, he finally discovered something beautiful. Who was the owner of that beautiful voice?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who said that? Where are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He shouts. No one answers. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, a burst of cold hits him. Snow starts falling around, filling the ground to about a foot high.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye stares at the ground in wonder, surprised by the sudden snowpour. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is this? Who is making this happen?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He asks aloud. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;They call me many names.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">The mysterious voice </span><span class="c7">singsongs</span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you about me, if you follow the sound of my voice&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They continue, their words now echoing throughout the town. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Kaye is intent on figuring this out. He follows the trail of the words, finding that they sound closer and closer, the further away from town he gets. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, from the distance, Kaye sees a golden and white light, growing brighter as it approaches. Coming into view, his eyes go wide as he sees a wondrous golden sleigh, being pulled by two majestic white reindeer that were entirely made of crystal.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sitting atop the sleigh was a tall woman with pale skin, who wore a white robe and a crown of gold horns. Her hair was silver and her eyes pale blue. She seemed to glow in the light of the sun, smiling warmly. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;Kaye, my dear boy, I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says melodically, descending her sleigh as it comes to a graceful stop near Kaye&rsquo;s frozen form. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who are you? What do you want?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye asks, entranced by what he&rsquo;s seeing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The mysterious woman walks closer to Kaye, her smile never fading. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am the Queen of Snow and Ice, here to humbly offer you a ride in my wonderful sleigh.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye takes a hesitant step back, but his curiosity keeps him rooted to the spot. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why would you be here for me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He asks, his eyes full of doubt. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen doesn&rsquo;t falter at his question, simply responding:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why Kaye, it&rsquo;s because I was drawn to you. We have a lot in common, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye responds, still doubtful. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen turns to face the village and grimaces. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You and I, we see the world for it truly is: a vile wretched mess. The beauty of this realm is being suppressed by those who live on it. Those like that awful friend of yours.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says sadly. Kaye flares in anger. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That Greta! What I would give to shut her up&ndash;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen places a finger on Kaye&rsquo;s mouth and motions him to look out past the village. There he sees just how much snow has fallen, blanketing the hills and valleys with several layers of ice. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye is hypnotized by how marvelous it is. The Snow Queen smiles at his reaction. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful isn&rsquo;t it? This is what the world should be, what it must be, how the wretched things ought to die. I can give you the power to make this world radiant again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She offers. Kaye turns to her in awe. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;can give me the power to do&hellip;this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He asks, slightly unsure. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh yes. We can take this terrible world and fill it with a sea of frozen fractals, cascading over all of the dead furloughs of ferns and other worthless rubbish! Only then, will the world be clean again, and when this happens, the whole world will be yours.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She explains. Kaye listens intently. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It can be&hellip;mine?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He asks. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen nods. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course it can. But only if you take my hand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen holds out her hand for him to shake. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you say? Would you like me to show you a world beyond your dreams? A world that can be yours to spread?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks, a malicious glint now appearing in her eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where will you take me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye asks, now fully enticed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why, my castle, of course! I shall test you to see if you truly have what it takes to accept the power I am giving you. All you have to do is shake my hand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says with a wide smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye takes a deep breath, and then grins. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Take me along, mysterious queen! I seek to make this world mine!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He exclaims, grasping her hand expectantly. The Snow Queen&rsquo;s smile grows wider. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&ldquo;You have made a wise decision </span><span class="c7">this night</span><span class="c0">, dear Kaye. Come aboard my sleigh, and we shall be off!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says triumphantly. Kaye follows her onto the golden sleigh, as she whips her crystal reindeer into action. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The sleigh flies off into the distance, as snow continues to fall around Wilfonde. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye looks out from his seat and with a final sneer, he bids &ldquo;good riddance&rdquo; to the town he wished he&rsquo;d never see again. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c19" id="h.1rsdridtmy46"><span class="c24">IV: Her Own Path</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta sat alone in her home, watching the fireplace as it flamed and crackled. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It had been five days since her friend Kaye started acting strangely, his once warm demeanor replaced by icy glares and sharp words. Even today, when she offered to keep him company while he was on break from school, Kaye responded with harshness. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta had racked her brain all morning, she just couldn&rsquo;t understand what could have caused such a sudden change in their friendship&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her mind was once again clouded with thoughts of their shared memories, moments filled with laughter and camaraderie. They had always been inseparable, supporting each other through thick and thin. But now, a wall stood between them, with no signs of breaking. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta sighs, standing up from her chair with a frown. She needed a change of pace. Sitting here, all she ended up doing was thinking about Kaye and how different he was. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Grandma, I&rsquo;m going out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright. Be careful, Greta.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her grandmother responds with a smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta nods and heads outside. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A sudden burst of cold hits her all at once, nearly startling her. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;C-cold&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She mutters, holding her arms together for warmth. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">When </span><span class="c7">had</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;it last been </span><span class="c7 c17">this</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;cold? It wasn&rsquo;t nearly as cold yesterday.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta frowned. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She knew when the last time was. That was the day that Kaye got caught in the snowstorm. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The day everything changed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The day her best friend turned against her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She shook her head. It wasn&rsquo;t good to dwell on such things. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lost in her thoughts, Greta barely noticed the hustle and bustle of the busy streets around her. The townsfolk hurried by, wrapped in their own lives and worries. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It seemed as though her own troubles were invisible to the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A glimmer of movement caught Greta&#39;s eye, diverting her attention from her somber ruminations. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She blinked, disbelief etched on her face, as she saw Kaye walking briskly down the street, his eyes locked on something unknown ahead. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Confusion mingled with a pang of worry in Greta&#39;s chest. What was Kaye doing? Where was he going? The borders of Wilfonde were that way, why would he go there? Determined to unravel his strange actions, her feet sprang into action, propelling her forward in pursuit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She followed him through the narrow alleys and winding paths of their quaint little town. The air grew colder with each passing moment, carrying with it a whisper of anticipation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Finally, as she turned a corner, she saw Kaye standing at the edge of town, staring at something far in the distance. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta watched with bated breath as a bright light came closer and closer, until the visage of a beautiful golden sleigh was visible to her. She gasps, in total awe of the aura it gave off. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye seemed to be staring at the figure who sat upon the sleigh, a mysterious woman with white hair and pale skin. There was something enchanting about her presence, a magnetic allure that seemed to draw him in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta could hear him asking. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am the Queen of Snow and Ice&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The mysterious woman was heard responding. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;...queen?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta whispered, not believing what she heard. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The two exchanged more words, and then the white haired woman climbed onto her sleigh, her long cloak billowing in the wind. And following right behind her, with no hesitation whatsoever, was Kaye.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&rsquo;s eyes grew wide, as she could see what was clearly about to happen. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Wait!&quot; Greta&#39;s voice echoed through the empty street, but it was too late. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The woman cracked her whip, and the sleigh lurched forward, disappearing into the wintry night. Greta desperately reached out a hand, her fingertips brushing against the cold air, but Kaye was gone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dismay washed over Greta, her heart sinking like a stone in her chest. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Why had Kaye followed that woman? What had possessed him to abandon their friendship so abruptly? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Questions swirled in her mind, each one stinging with the pain of uncertainty.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With a heavy sigh, Greta leaned against the wall of a nearby building, her eyes fixed on the spot where the sleigh had vanished. She felt an icy gust of wind whip through the empty street, carrying away the remnants of her hopes and dreams. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kaye&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta whispered, not noticing the tears that were building in her eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She slowly sauntered back home, shakily relaying the terrible news to Kaye&rsquo;s parents. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At once, they got to searching around town, hoping someone would have any information about the case. Unfortunately, that only gave them dead leads and broken wills. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Days even passed, but their efforts all amounted to nothing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta sat down for dinner one night, saying nothing other than simple greetings. It was very quiet, despite both families being there. Everyone was discouraged, worried they would never see Kaye again. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye&rsquo;s parents were starting to lose hope. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Papa&hellip;is there nothing more we can do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta asked desperately. Kaye&rsquo;s parents looked away with frowns on their faces. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re out of leads&hellip;I wish there were more&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&rsquo;s father responded sadly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta stands up in anger. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t just give up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She shouts. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s still out there! I know he is! I can&rsquo;t just leave him alone!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye&rsquo;s father looks to the ground. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I want to search as much as you do, but&hellip;Kaye is too far gone for us to look&hellip;danger would befall us outside the village. We just have to hope he comes back to us&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta slams her fork down on the table. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not enough!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She shouts. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Greta&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her father tries to say, but she cuts him off. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you not care about your own son?! Are you going to let your fears get in the way of finding him? We need to leave this village to find him!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She exclaims furiously. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Greta, dear.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&rsquo;s grandmother says softly, placing her hands on her shoulders. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Grandma&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Grandmother smiles. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t alone in your frustration, Greta. We all want to bring Kaye back, but it&rsquo;s not that easy. Sometimes, the best thing to do in these situations is wait.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta frowns and then sighs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;...okay.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She sits down, feeling dejected. Silence reigned over the room for the rest of dinner. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta was starting to get fed up with everyone&rsquo;s decision to stay in the village. She felt that being here wasn&rsquo;t helping them look for Kaye at all. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s funny, she was against his idea to leave the village before, but now she wanted so badly to do the same thing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She made up her mind. She would embark on a journey to save her friend, even if it meant never seeing her childhood home again. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta just hoped she wouldn&rsquo;t get lost herself. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Late in the night, Greta sat at her desk, scribbling a note for her father and grandmother, assuring them that she would be safe and explaining her intentions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She knew they would be worried once they found out what she did, but she just couldn&rsquo;t abandon Kaye. She had to save him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta stood up and walked over to her bed. She stuffed some necessities and clothes into a backpack that sat there, and then went back to her desk. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She grabs her written note and takes it downstairs, placing it carefully on the kitchen table. She also sneaks some snacks into her pocket for later. Once that was done, she headed back up to her room and pulled her bag over her shoulders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Taking a deep breath, Greta closes her eyes, building confidence in herself, and then she sneaks over to the window.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She undoes the latch and prepares to step out, but a sound near the door catches her attention. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Greta.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta quickly whips around, startled and grimacing at this flaw in her plan, but she relaxes upon seeing who it is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Grandma&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Going somewhere so late?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&rsquo;s grandmother asks with a knowing smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was&hellip;going to find Kaye&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta says nervously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&rsquo;s grandmother walks over to her and hugs her lovingly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are so brave, Greta. After all you&rsquo;ve been though, you still stand tall. I&rsquo;m sure Kaye has helped you through all of it. So go to him, and bring him back to us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta smiles through tears and nods. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, grandma.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They part, Greta looks back one more time, and then she leaves through the unlocked window. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her grandma watches for a few minutes, frowning. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Be careful, Greta.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She whispers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As far as journeys go, Greta&rsquo;s was off to a rough start. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was past the town&rsquo;s borders after several hours, but her directional skills weren&rsquo;t very good. She had no idea where she was, and there were hills all around her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Several carriages had passed her along the way, but none of them wanted to take Greta as a passenger. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hello, um, could you take me with you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She would ask.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Get your own carriage!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They would shout, laughing while they did so. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta was discouraged, but she continued on as best she could. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After hours, no, days of mindless wandering, she finally found something: a wooden sign. It told her to follow the direction of the valley just a little bit further, and there would be an outpost. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta willingly followed its words. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The sun began its descent, casting long shadows across the rugged landscape as she made the long trek, finally arriving at the outpost in the middle of night. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The air crackled with a palpable sense of adventure and danger, as if each gust carried tales of malicious exploits and hidden motives. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The buildings, made of weathered timber and sturdy stone, loomed over the bustling streets that teemed with a motley crew of ruffians and adventurers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Greta stepped into the heart of the town, the clamor of voices and the clinking of tankards filled her ears. She couldn&#39;t help but feel a pang of unease amidst this unfamiliar chaos. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cautiously pressing on, she approached a weathered tavern, its sign creaking in the breeze. The scent of ale and hearty meals wafted through the air, luring her inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Within the dimly lit tavern, Greta&#39;s eyes swept across the crowded room. Roughened faces stared back at her, some curious, others indifferent, clearly they had seen countless travelers pass through their midst. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She spotted a weathered barkeep behind the counter, wiping down glasses with a worn rag. With a deep breath to steady herself, she approached him.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um, excuse me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta shouts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, what is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The bartender begrudgingly responds, not appreciating her yelling in his ears. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for someone, a boy with auburn hair and blue eyes. Have you seen him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone like that. If you aren&rsquo;t here to buy something, I suggest you leave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He snaps rudely. Greta flinches at his words and saunters away, slightly upset. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How rude&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She whispers. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Looking around the bar, Greta decides to ask other people, hoping they would give her better answers. She weaves through the crowd, her eyes darting anxiously from face to face. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She approaches a table where a group of winged women are engaged in animated conversation. These were fairies, and this was Greta&rsquo;s first time seeing them. She shook her head upon realizing that she was staring. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were more important things to worry about than that. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Excuse me, have any of you seen my friend Kaye? He vanished a few days ago with a mysterious white-haired woman and I&rsquo;m really worried for him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The fairies exchange nervous glances, their expressions now guarded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry, lass. We haven&#39;t seen anyone matching that description. Now, if you&#39;ll excuse us&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They turn their backs on Greta, continuing their discussion as if she weren&rsquo;t there. Undeterred, Greta moves back to the bar, where a large horned creature sits hunched over a mug of ale. This was a troll, she could tell. Cautiously, she inches close to it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please, sir, have you seen my friend Kaye? He went missing and I&#39;m desperate to find him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The troll grumbles, his voice low and gravelly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ain&#39;t got time for lost kids, lass. Go pester someone else.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&#39;s heart sinks, feeling the weight of her desperation. She spots a group of long-eared individuals engaged in a lively game of cards nearby. These were elves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Excuse me, can any of you help me? My friend Kaye is missing, and I don&#39;t know where to look.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The elves exchange quick glances before resuming their game, deliberately ignoring her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&#39;ve got no time for human troubles. Find someone else to bother.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&#39;s eyes welled up with tears, her frustration reaching a tipping point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She storms over to the bar and collapses at the counter. Feeling famished, she looks to the bartender and hesitantly asks:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can I get a drink?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The bartender turns to her, more interested than he had been before. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What kind?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He responds. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um&hellip;something hard, I guess?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says. The bartender nods, and then hands her reddish colored beer, in exchange for two silver coins. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta is scared to try it, but her famishness takes over her better judgment. She gingerly sips some of it, and immediately grimaces. Her vision goes a little fuzzy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She didn&rsquo;t like that drink whatsoever. Not one bit. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The tipsy feelings were not what she wanted at all. She pushes it away. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mm&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Trying to get rid of the strange things that were happening to her, Greta rubs her head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, two guys, who were at the end of the bar, walk up to her, smiling maliciously. They sit on the stools next to her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, that drink isn&rsquo;t for lightweights, missy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">One of them laughs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You look a little tipsy. Why don&rsquo;t we take you to get some fresh air?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The other says with a grin. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip;I&rsquo;m not interested&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta mutters, slightly scared. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why? We only want what&rsquo;s best for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s for your own good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They say, smirking. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta turns away from them, desperate to be alone. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please&hellip;I want to be alone right now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She murmurs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You wench! When will you shut up and listen?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">One of the lecherous guys yells, grabbing her by the arm. He forcefully pulls her from the stool and tries to get her to go outside, as she struggles to get free.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey! Let me go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta cries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Be quiet and come with us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The other guy shouts. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Now they were both grabbing her, preventing her from fighting back. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stop it! Let go of me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She screams. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">One of the guys tries to slap her, but his hand is grabbed from behind. A mysterious hooded guy is holding him back. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Hey you brutes, you&rsquo;re making a scene! Let go of the </span><span class="c7">lass</span><span class="c0">!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He yells. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The lecherous guys let go of Greta and sneer at the hooded figure. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who do you think you are?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They ask. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Just a friendly passerby.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He responds, pulling out a sword. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you leave before this gets serious?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He threatens. The two guys back off, grumbling as they leave the bar. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Greta</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;falls to her knees, holding her chest as she does so. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;T-thank you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She mutters. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The hooded figure smiles and holds out his hand for her to take. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. Here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He says. Greta accepts and comes to her feet. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They sit at the bar to talk. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a nice place for a </span><span class="c7">lass</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;like you to visit. What brings you here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The hooded figure asks, grabbing a drink from the bartender. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s&hellip;about my friend, Kaye. He disappeared a few days ago and I&rsquo;m trying to find him. There was this woman, she had white hair and pale skin. She rode a golden sleigh that flew! I think she enticed him with something, but I don&#39;t know what it is. Does any of that strike you as familiar?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The hooded figure remains silent, his gaze fixed on a swirling vortex in the glass on the bar counter. Greta probes him again, her voice trembling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please, I&#39;ll do anything to find him. He means so much to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The hooded figure finally looks up, his eyes glinting with compassion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I may have heard whispers of such a woman. But it&#39;s a dangerous path you tread, lass. Are you truly prepared?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta nods, her determination unwavering.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, I&#39;ll face any danger if it means finding Kaye. Please, tell me what you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The hooded figure leans in, their voice barely a whisper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There are tales passed down amongst adventurers regarding a white haired witch from the east. They call her the &lsquo;Snow Queen&rsquo;, and say that she has the power to freeze a man to death with the crack of her fingers. Many have gone missing seeking to claim her power. If what you have told me is true, then your friend has gone down a ghastly road.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&rsquo;s eyes widened at his words. She had heard the mysterious woman say the phrase &lsquo;Queen of Snow and Ice&rsquo; but she didn&rsquo;t believe it. What was going to happen to Kaye?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How can I find her? Where does she live?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The hooded figure takes a swig of his drink. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No one knows exactly, but the common belief is that she resides in a cursed castle past the borders of the capital city. You would have to go through the Rotted Elms in order to reach such a place. Not something I&rsquo;d recommend, lass.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta frowns.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have to go there. I must save Kaye.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The hooded figure sighs, and then places a hand on her shoulder. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How about I get you a room in the nearby inn, and we can talk about this more in the morning?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He suggests. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Greta looks up at him, </span><span class="c7">hope filling</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;her face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. I don&rsquo;t mind helping someone who asks for it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He says with a smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta smiles at him in return, thankful for the chance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you. I mean it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The hooded figure nods. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No problem. Now let&rsquo;s get you a nice place to stay.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He says, motioning for the door.

Crystal reindeer, their hooves glimmering with an otherworldly light, pulled them effortlessly across the wintry landscape.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">When they met, the Snow Queen had enticed Kaye with the promise of unrivaled power and dominion over the world. And now, as they traveled through the realms, she intended to show him the vastness of that power and the beauty of a world under their control.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Behold, Kaye.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen&#39;s voice echoed with a sense of dark satisfaction. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is the world that will bow to your will.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">As they soared over snow-capped mountains and icy lakes, the Snow Queen pointed with a gloved hand, her voice laced with a mixture of pride and temptation. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Look, Kaye, at the cities below. Once insignificant, but soon to be yours to command.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Kaye&#39;s heart swelled with an intoxicating mix of awe and ambition. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To think that I could shape entire cities to my whims&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">He murmured, his voice filled with a newfound hunger. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Imagine the fear they would feel, the power they would know I possess.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen&#39;s eyes gleamed with satisfaction as she cast a spell, conjuring a mighty storm that danced across the sky. Lightning bolts shattered ancient trees with a single strike, setting the surrounding forest ablaze. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is the power that awaits you, Kaye.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">She whispered. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To command the very elements, to reshape the world as you desire.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Kaye watched in awe as the destructive beauty unfolded before his eyes. The blue flames danced with a malevolent grace, reflecting in the icy depths of his corrupted eye. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Such power&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">He murmured, his voice laced with fascination. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;With this, none will be able to defy me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">But as they reached the heart of a frozen forest, the Snow Queen shifted her focus to a different kind of magic. She extended her arms, and a swirl of snowflakes surrounded the sleigh, forming an ethereal cocoon of shimmering ice and frost. Within this magical dome, the world transformed before their eyes.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Kaye&#39;s breath caught in his throat as the scene unfolded. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">He found himself standing in a vision of the future, a world encased in snow and ice. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Towering ice palaces gleamed in the distance, their spires reaching for the heavens. Snowflakes drifted lazily from the sky, their gentle touch leaving a sparkling sheen on every surface.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This, my dear Kaye, is what awaits us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen whispered, her voice filled with anticipation. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A world where snow and ice reign supreme, where every corner bows to our command.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">As Kaye gazed upon the vision, he couldn&#39;t help but feel a surge of excitement. The sheer beauty and power that radiated from this frozen realm enticed him. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen&#39;s words echoed in his mind, promising a place by her side, ruling together in this enchanting domain.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">He watched as people, once strangers to him, moved about the snow-covered streets. </span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">They were not merely surviving in this icy world; they were thriving under the rule of the Snow Queen and himself. The citizens bowed, their faces filled with reverence and fear. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">It was a sight that both thrilled and intoxicated him.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Imagine, Kaye.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen said, her voice soft yet commanding. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You and I, the rulers of this magnificent realm. Every soul will kneel before us, and we shall shape their lives as we see fit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Kaye&#39;s heart swelled with a sense of purpose and belonging. In this vision, he saw his desires fulfilled, his lust for power realized. It was a world where his twisted ambitions would find their true form, where he would stand alongside the Snow Queen, the embodiment of his dreams.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">The vision gradually faded, the snowflakes melting away and returning them to their journey through the wintry landscape. But the impression it left on Kaye lingered, planting a seed of desire within him. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">His longing for power and love had merged, entwined with the Snow Queen herself.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">As they continued their ride, Kaye found himself growing further attached to the Snow Queen. Her every word and action mesmerized him, ensnaring his heart deeper within her web of darkness. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">He found solace in her presence, his twisted soul finding a kindred spirit in her.</span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">In the hours that followed, the Snow Queen shared tales of ancient magic, weaving spells with her delicate hands that painted vibrant pictures in the air. She spoke of conquest and dominion, her voice dripping with seduction and promises of untold power.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Kaye listened intently, his mind intoxicated by the Snow Queen&#39;s words. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">The more he learned, the more he hungered for the dominion she offered. The desire to possess that power, to bend the world to his will, consumed him like a voracious flame.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Days turned into nights, and nights into days, as they journeyed through the wintry realms. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen showcased her dominion over the elements, conjuring blizzards that swept through desolate landscapes and freezing lakes with a mere flick of her wrist. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Kaye stood beside her, his heart swelling with a sense of awe and admiration. With each display of power, he grew more enamored with her.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">As the golden sleigh continued its journey through the night sky, Kaye&#39;s eyes fixed upon the Snow Queen, her beauty radiating in the moon&#39;s silvery glow. His heart, now twisted and corrupted, was filled with words he dared not speak aloud: he was in love with the Snow Queen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><h3 class="c19" id="h.qh481ekrkcag"><span class="c16">VI: Her Prickly Roses</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kaye!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta awoke with a start, finding herself in an unfamiliar setting. At first she was confused, but then she remembered yesterday, and how the hooded figure helped her get some lodgings. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She felt so thankful that he was there to save her that time. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta stumbles out of bed and pulls on some new clothes. She freshens herself up for the day, and then heads downstairs to the tavern part of the inn, making sure to grab her backpack along the way. There she sees the hooded figure drinking a beer. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good morning, lass.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He says with a smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Morning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta greets him with a smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a talk.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He says, motioning to a nearby table. They go to sit down. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So we discussed the Rotted Elms yesterday. That place isn&rsquo;t for the faint of heart. I prepared this map to guide you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The mysterious figure hands her a drawn map, complete with written advice. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you. This will help a lot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta says. She stores it in her backpack. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now, before you go, I want to warn you about this path you&rsquo;re taking. The Rotted Elms are a wretched place for even the most experienced adventurers, and I recommend you think long and hard before trying to go in there. Also, don&rsquo;t ignore the warnings on the map. They&rsquo;re there for a reason.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The hooded figure advises. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta nods in understanding, but brushes off his worries. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can handle it. I have to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says confidently. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you say so&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He responds, and then pulls out a pocket knife in a scabbard. He hands it to her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;At least take this with you. Going without a weapon isn&rsquo;t a good idea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta accepts the knife, attaching it to her leg. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Seriously, I can&rsquo;t thank you enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says, smiling. The hooded figure laughs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to thank me. Now let&rsquo;s order some food. You need sustenance before you go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta responds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After breakfast, Greta and the hooded figure parted ways. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta approached the edge of the outpost, feeling both scared and determined. She takes a deep breath, and heads out with Kaye in mind. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Pulling out the map, she follows the earthen path laid out ahead of her. Admittedly, the map was hard to understand, as Greta hadn&rsquo;t really used maps before, but it didn&rsquo;t matter. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She had to figure it out if she wanted to find Kaye. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta found herself walking through farmlands, valleys, even large meadows of beautiful flowers. But she didn&rsquo;t stop. She kept going, determined to find her way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Eventually, she ended up in a small hall of trees, where two pathways lay. A wooden sign pointed in both directions, naming them with letters that had long faded away. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta observed the map, noticing a note that reads: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take the right path. Roses lay there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She doesn&rsquo;t understand. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Roses lay there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta asks aloud. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">From what she could see from the map, the right path was quicker, but the note was telling her to take the left path. Why?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t make a difference, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta didn&rsquo;t want to doubt her hooded friend, but her mind was telling her to go the faster route. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After a few minutes of deliberation, and enjoying a quick snack, Greta made the final decision to do just that. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The right path seems pretty normal at first. Old trees surrounded her, full of ancient history. Mysterious creatures shimmied through the shrubbery at her feet, slightly jostling her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Greta pushed through the underbrush, she found herself standing on the threshold of a seemingly hidden grotto. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was like the trees had conspired to create a secret quiet sanctuary, forming a circle, with branches that reached towards the sky. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Soft moss-covered ground cushioned her feet as she walked forward into the grotto. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was at that moment when Greta&rsquo;s gaze fell upon a pristine white cottage nestled at the center of the clearing, like an ethereal structure erected by god. Its walls shined, making it seem like it didn&rsquo;t belong there, and Greta was absolutely surprised by its sudden appearance. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How quaint&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She muttered. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A mixture of awe and trepidation filled her mind as she continued forward, cautiously approaching the house, with the expectation that anything could be living there. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;Turn back!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A small voice suddenly said, stopping her in her tracks. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta looked around for the source of it, but couldn&rsquo;t find it. She should have listened to those words, but the cottage looked innocent enough, so she ignored them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With a deep breath, she reached for the doorknob and turned it, pushing the front door open carefully. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Another small voice said, but Greta didn&rsquo;t listen. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The interior of the cottage was a massive contrast to the exterior. Rose red wallpaper lined the walls. Bookshelves seemed to be around every corner, stuffed full with old texts. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;Turn back!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The small voice said again, but Greta kept walking, as if in a trance. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A weird aura seemed to flow through the house&rsquo;s walls, filling her with a strange feeling she couldn&rsquo;t explain. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&rsquo;s eyes then widened in surprise, as she spotted a woman standing at the far end of the room she was in. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was an older woman, wearing a red sweater and white dress, and her eyes were red like rubies. The old woman walked over to Greta with a mysterious smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been expecting you, little traveler. You seem lost.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta asked, backing up slightly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why, my name is Miss Myrtle, I&rsquo;m the old witch of these woods! It brings me such joy to play with young girls like you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The old woman replies, running her hand through Greta&rsquo;s hair. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Miss&hellip;Myrtle&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta repeated. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her instincts were screaming madly at her to flee, but a queer curiosity kept her rooted to the spot. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;Flee!&rdquo; &ldquo;Flee!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The small voices cried again, but this time Greta was too mesmerized to even consider them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The air in the room was growing heavy, laden with a scent that reminded her of blooming flowers, sweet yet sickeningly intense and overwhelming. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Come with me, dear child. For now that you have arrived, I must show you my wonderful garden!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Says Miss Myrtle. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c17">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A small voice cried. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta tilted her head, she opened her mouth to speak, but words seemed to be forced out of her throat against her better judgment. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;...okay&hellip;Miss&hellip;Myrtle&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She muttered, in a trance-like state. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The old woman smiled, taking her by the hand. Greta let herself be led along, not even really knowing what she was doing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She found herself in the backyard of the cottage, where rows of red and white roses lay growing in picket-fence troughs. The roses gave off an alluring fragrance, which made Greta&rsquo;s vision go slightly fuzzy when she inhaled it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miss Myrtle led her to a large trough at the end of the garden, where three large red-orange roses were blooming brilliantly, radiating an enticing aroma that made Greta want to get closer to it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Just then, all at once, a flurry of small voices invaded her ears.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;Stop, girl!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch the roses!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;Turn back!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;Fly away from here!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;Turn back!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;Turn back!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;Turn back!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;Turn back!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta stopped in her tracks, causing the old woman to turn around and look at her in confusion. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, child?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks with feigned worry. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Greta doesn&rsquo;t know how to respond, but she can see her surroundings now, and didn&rsquo;t think going further was a good idea. That was when she noticed something terrifying: the roses were </span><span class="c7 c17">moving</span><span class="c0">. They were breathing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was very wary now. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip;I don&rsquo;t think I want to see your roses anymore, Miss Myrtle. I have to go find my friend, Kaye.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says, releasing her grip on the old woman&rsquo;s hand. Miss Myrtle frowns at her, a twitch in her eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My child, don&rsquo;t you like the sight of my roses? They&rsquo;re simply beautiful. Your friend Kaye is probably dead already. Stay here with me, and you&rsquo;ll be safe for the rest of your life!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She exclaims. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta backs up slowly, slightly unnerved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um, I can&rsquo;t stay here!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She yells, trying to get away quickly, but the old woman grabs her by the hand, glaring. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;DON&rsquo;T RUN FROM ME!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She cries, and then lunges at Greta, who can see fangs protruding from her mouth and death in her eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She pushes back as hard as she can, trying to pry the old woman off of her, but Miss Myrtle was very strong, despite her appearance. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You should stay here, where the world is beautiful! My roses are better than anything in the outer world!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miss Myrtle cries hysterically. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta is losing the battle, her hands in pain from how hard she was grasping. What could she do to get this old woman off of her?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;Your knife!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A small voice cries. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c17">&ldquo;Use your knife!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta suddenly remembers. She briefly stops struggling, lulling Miss Myrtle into a false sense of security. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve stopped resisting! Finally you understand the beauty of&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c18 c11">SKKRT!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c11"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Using the opportunity to her advantage, Greta had pulled the hooded figure&rsquo;s knife from her scabbard and plunged it into the old woman&rsquo;s stomach. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Agh! You foul, miserable, BRAT!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She cries, stumbling backward into one of the rose troughs due to her injury. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;When I get my hands on you, I&rsquo;m going to&ndash; AH!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">The old woman was preparing to lunge at </span><span class="c7">Greta</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;again, but thick green tentacles had wrapped around her, emerging from the red roses she had stumbled into. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let go of me! I am your creator! No!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta winces as the old woman is lifted into the air by the slimy tentacles, before being swallowed alive by her own monstrous roses. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She almost stumbles back herself, but just barely avoids touching the other roses, which seem to glare at her as if to say, &lsquo;come closer&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta runs back into the house and out the front door in her attempt to get as far away as possible. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She looks down at her knife-wielding hand, which was bloody and shaking from when she stabbed Miss Myrtle. The sight of it made her feel squeamish. She hoped she could find a stream to wash her hands in. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She continues down the path she came, glad to still be alive. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta wanted to thank those small voices she heard, but at the moment she still had no idea where they originated from. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where you are&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She starts,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But thank you for saving me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She finishes aloud. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hearing no answer, Greta shakes her head and continues on her way. Just as she&rsquo;s leaving, a small voice says: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c17">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Greta looks back towards the cottage, looking for the source. Nothing. She turns away with a frown, but then&hellip;out of the corner of her eye, she spots a white rose and it was </span><span class="c7 c17">moving,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;like those from the old woman&rsquo;s garden. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After looking a little closer, she realized it wasn&rsquo;t just moving. It was waving to her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A big, wide smile formed on Greta&rsquo;s face, and she waved back, finally comprehending. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Roses lay here&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She muttered, chuckling dryly as she now fully understood the true meaning of those words. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c19" id="h.vrl5ccoreezd"><span class="c16">VII: Her Forest Fears</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Walking along the leftward path, Greta wondered if she was truly up for the tribulations of adventure. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It had been an hour since she departed from the old woman&rsquo;s cottage, and so far everything seemed calm. However, Greta&rsquo;s heart was anything but. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She could still remember the feeling of stabbing a living human being, and it was affecting her to a terrible degree. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta never thought she would end up killing someone, and wished she didn&rsquo;t have to. The true dangers of her journey were starting to reveal themselves, and now she knew she couldn&rsquo;t take things lightly anymore. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She shakily lifts her hand, staring soberly at the now dry blood. Would she have to see more, if she continued on this dreadful path? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta frowned, wiping her face before her tears could fall. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She just had to accept it. This was what she chose. If she didn&rsquo;t, she would probably never see Kaye again. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Anything&hellip;for Kaye&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Could she really do anything for him? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta shook her head, trying to get those awful thoughts out of her mind before they consumed her. She couldn&rsquo;t turn back now. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Building her confidence as much as she could, she looks ahead with determination. Her eyes go wide. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&rsquo;s long trek had led her to the end of a winding path, revealing a thick, dense forest. The once vibrant and lush foliage now appeared sickly, with gnarled and twisted branches that seemed rotted at the core. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The sky above was dark and foreboding, much like the forest itself, and the trees seemed to move like they were truly alive. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Directly in front of her, arching trees seemed to create a natural, eerie gateway, beckoning her forth. The air of the surroundings also seemed to be drawing her in, as if it was calling her name in the winds. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta took a hesitant step forward, weary from her previous experience. All at once, a thick haze fell over her vision. She was uncertain, scared, nervous, but she shakily steeled herself and stepped into the decaying woods. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The moss at her feet was thicker now, yet also dead at the same time, and she couldn&rsquo;t make out her shoes through it. The earth beneath was damp, wet, it felt like she would sink straight through if she didn&rsquo;t keep walking. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With each step she made, whispered voices flew amongst the trees. Shadows danced and swirled around her, compounding the haziness in her eyes even more so, until reality itself seemed distorted. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta didn&rsquo;t know what it was, but something in this forest seemed to be telling her that she wasn&rsquo;t wanted. Suddenly, with a rustling of dead leaves and the shrill of strings, large flying beetles burst from the trees, startling her to the point of falling. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah! Get away!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She cried, swatting them with her hands, as they tried to gnaw at her in turn. One of the bugs snips at her middle finger, leaving a grotesque hole of ooze and blood. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eeek!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta held her hand in pain as she screamed, sending the gross beetles scurrying away in fear. Something was in there now, but she didn&rsquo;t know what it was. Stinging pain shot up each time she tried to move it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mhn&hellip;it hurts&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She muttered, weakly walking through the damp, rotted forest with a frown on her face. Stumbling along what seemed like the right path, mischievous voices raced past her ears. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;Pathetic little girl!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve wandered too far!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be dead within the hour!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The voices giggled in amusement at her pain and suffering, and Greta could only whimper and muster through it, hoping they&rsquo;d go away. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She finds herself in a large canopy, the trees overhead seeming to create a ceiling of rotting moss and shrubbery. The sun wasn&rsquo;t visible at all, and when she turned around, she found that her surroundings were very unfamiliar. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Paths extended in various directions, all looking identical to each other, and Greta couldn&rsquo;t tell which one she used or where to go next. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s&hellip;the path?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She whispers, her eyes growing tireder by the second. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The mischievous voices giggled at her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;No you fool, I believe it&rsquo;s the other way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;No, I think it&rsquo;s this way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;What way is that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;This way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;Oh, of course, that way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Their words were confusing, deliberately so, and Greta found she couldn&rsquo;t understand anything or anyone. Where to go? Where to go?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c18 c11">ROOOAR!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c11"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, a loud roar rings out between the trees, causing the ground to visibly shake. Greta goes pale, rooted to the spot in fear. She wants to scream, but nothing comes out. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A large black mass bursts through several nearby trees, sending shreds of wood and earth flying in various directions. Sharp, pointed teeth dripping with saliva face her, protruding from the mouth of a large ferocious panther. Its fur was as black as night, its eyes were as red as death. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta backs up slowly, trying not to antagonize it, but it leaps forth in its animalistic aggression. She jumps behind a fallen tree log, shaking as she does so. She had never been so scared in her entire life, as the panther stalked the area for her presence. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She pulls out her knife, holding it for dear life, as the panther slowly approaches her position. Suddenly, it leaps towards her, roaring as it does so. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta puts her head between her legs, causing the panther to land behind her. She turns around just as it prepares to attack her once again. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Within the course of a few seconds, she shakily drives her knife into the top of the panther&#39;s skull, but at the same time, she feels a stinging, blaring pain in her body and groans agonizingly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Blood trickles down Greta&rsquo;s right arm and shirt, the panther&rsquo;s teeth having sunk in very deeply. Greta sharply removed herself from the monster&rsquo;s mouth, causing her to scream out as the pain increased tenfold. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The panther scurries off in a belligerent state, taking her knife with it. Even if it died nearby, Greta was in too much pain to try and look for it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She falls to her knees and digs in her backpack for something to stop the bleeding. She grabs an old shirt and wraps it around her in an amateur way. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ow&hellip;ow!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She hisses, the aging cloth feeling horribly rough against her skin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Taking a much needed break, she also procures some stale porridge from the outpost, eating all of it despite the awful taste. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gross&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She mutters with a grimace. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta looks for something to get rid of the taste and finds her water cask. She opens it and tries to quench her thirst, but nothing comes out. She peers inside with a confused look. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where did it all go?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks aloud. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She was so thirsty, and the porridge didn&rsquo;t help with that. She wearily stands up and goes down a random path, hoping for luck. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Deeper and deeper she went into the forest, the darker and darker it became. No matter how much Greta looked, the sun was no longer visible by her eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her legs were starting to grow tired, and after a while, she had no idea how much time was passing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In a bout of good luck, she suddenly stumbles upon a babbling brook, its crystal clear waters looking delicious to a massively thirsty Greta. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She quickly leans down and cups her hands, taking several large sips of water. Her body was starting to feel light again, and Greta breathed a sigh of relief at this break from all the madness. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But in this cursed forest, there was unfortunately no such thing as a &ldquo;break&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For soon after she drank that delicious water, Greta felt hungry once more. She didn&rsquo;t think much of it at first, consuming a piece of bread nonchalantly at the feeling. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But then it kept happening. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ever so often, Greta would find herself wanting food again, and after a while, it got to the point where she was always hungry, no matter what she ate. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Her body was </span><span class="c7 c17">too </span><span class="c0">light. She couldn&rsquo;t feel the taste of food and she couldn&rsquo;t feel the release of hunger. Then she felt thirsty, but the water of the brook couldn&rsquo;t quench her at all. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta was growing miserable, lonely, sad, and discouraged.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thirsty&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She whined. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The mysterious voices began to giggle again. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so stupid!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">One of them says, </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t drink the sacred water! What a fool!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Another </span><span class="c7">teases</span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta cried in annoyance. She didn&rsquo;t need this, not right now. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hours&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Or was it days?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Months?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Some amount of time passed since Greta drank from the brook and experienced true miserableness. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She herself knew not how long she had been in this forest, but it didn&rsquo;t really matter to her anyway. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She had stopped counting the days since her departure a while ago&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But no matter how much time elapsed, Greta was in a state of weakness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Every muscle in her body felt sore, even moving her arms was painful. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&rsquo;s legs were on the brink of failing her, the food and little drink she had saved up was gone, devoured in an attempt to satiate her gnawing appetite and thirst.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At this point, her clothes were also filthy and disgusting. Greta could feel that her undergarments and pants were soaked with sweat and she was so weak that she even pissed herself a few times. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was just too difficult to crouch and remove clothing for something like using the bathroom. Greta&rsquo;s dignity no longer mattered. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, a loud piercing screeching sound reaches her ears. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c18 c11">SCREEEEE!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Bursting from the trees was a monstrous, pitch black colored, red eyed vulture, its feathers bathed in fire and smoke. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Vul&hellip;ture&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta mutters weakly, falling to her knees from the sight of it, and all at once, everything that came before hit her like a rock. She couldn&rsquo;t do it. She gave up. She didn&rsquo;t want to fight back anymore. Not if it meant nothing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah&hellip;I&hellip;can&rsquo;t&hellip;so&hellip;weak&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She just sat, staring at the monster with sad, distraught eyes. Her thoughts went to Kaye, to her father, to her grandma, and to her late mother. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Would she never see her family again? Would she finally join her mother on the other side?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Would she never be able to tell Kaye how much she loved him?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">Greta couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to stand. In fact, it was physically impossible for her body to move at this moment, she was just </span><span class="c7 c17">that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;weak. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The vulture, seeing her drop her guard, lunges forward with full force. She closes her eyes&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&hellip;but the impact doesn&rsquo;t reach her, as a thick wooden spear comes flying through the trees, piercing the monster straight in its head. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&rsquo;s vision grows fuzzy as she looks around for the source of this attack. Suddenly a young brown-haired girl appears from the trees and runs over to her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her hair was braided and her features were soft. She analyzes Greta with a worried expression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you alright? That foul thing didn&rsquo;t hurt you, did it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The girl asks. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta finds it hard to respond, her throat is aching for water, and she really wants something to eat. She just barely shakes her head, and then breathes out the words:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank&hellip;you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The last bit of strength leaving her, Greta faints, as the tribal girl shakes her worriedly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c19" id="h.szwjz1u02qob"><span class="c16">VIII: Her Savior&rsquo;s Village</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&rsquo;s eyes fluttered open, her surroundings unfamiliar and hazy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sunlight shown through cracks in the foundation of a thatched roof above her. Various charms and baskets of flowers surrounded the leaf bed she lay upon, giving the room &nbsp;a calm atmosphere. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta tried to sit up, but winced, as a sharp pain shot throughout her entire body. She groaned, her head spinning wildly with confusion. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Where was she? What had happened? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Easy now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A soft voice suddenly whispered, breaking through the haze. Greta turned her head, her eyes meeting those of a young girl with forest-green eyes and a warm smile. Her brown, braided hair cascaded around her shoulders, and she wore garments adorned with patterns that seemed to blend in with nature. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Worry was etched all over her face.. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who&hellip;who are you? What am I doing here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta croaked, her voice barely audible amongst the sounds of the forest. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The girl&rsquo;s lips curved into a warm smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am Fae. I&rsquo;ve been nursing you ever since you fainted in the woods.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&rsquo;s gaze wandered over her body, noticing the bandages wrapped around her wounded arm and the soothing salve applied to her scratches and bruises. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She frowned, remembering everything that happened, and the things she endured. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae notices this and grabs her right arm, rubbing it softly with her hands. She then kisses it, allowing her mouth to linger there for several seconds. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It still hurts, doesn&rsquo;t it? I tried my best to mend your wounds, but if there&rsquo;s a problem, please tell me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says, slightly worried. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta turns away, blushing at the sudden contact. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;N-no, you did a good job. Thank you for rescuing me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She mutters. Her expression then turns somber, tears appearing in her eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was so ready to die&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with empathy. She hugs Greta gently and holds her close. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The Rotted Elms are a horrible place. You went through so much, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta felt calm in her embrace, and her just emotions started pouring out like water from a broken faucet. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&hellip;it was so scary&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think such an awful place existed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It was like&hellip;every step I took, my energy was being taken away&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She whined. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae nodded. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You were suffering from &lsquo;Deficiency Sickness&rsquo;, a terrible disease that affects those unprepared to enter the forest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta tilted her head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Deficiency sickness?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks, surprised at the unfamiliar term.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s a phenomenon that occurs within the Rotted Elms. All of your mana is sucked out over a long period of time until you die.

She discovered the many food dishes that the village chef prepares, and found that she loved every one. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were lots of interesting tidbits about the tribe, but Greta mostly enjoyed learning them just because found peace in Fae&rsquo;s company. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">By the end of the first day, they were already friends, and they really liked experiencing the tribal lifestyle together. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Many nights they spent studying the stars, sleeping alongside one another. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oftentimes, Greta would ask questions, and Fae was more than willing to answer. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is there a religion here in the village?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She once asked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Not really. We mostly worship nature. Mother nature is the real god that </span><span class="c7">resides</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;over all of us. When she decides that it&rsquo;s our time to die, she sends us up to the stars.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae responded, pointing to the night sky. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;All of our ancestors reside up there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says with a smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta took in her words on this matter with a heavy heart. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The death of her mother was many years ago, but it still had a place inside her. But for the first time, she felt truly at peace with the hard truth. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her mother was simply a star. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My mother&hellip;she&rsquo;s up there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta asked, sad emotions filling her face. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae nodded, also feeling emotional.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;my father is up there, too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says with a sad smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No words were exchanged after that, but through that conversation, the two grew closer. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They shared all they could with each other, and it was clear that their friendship was becoming incredibly strong. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A month passed before Greta could walk normally again. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When she first realized it, she was ecstatic. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can walk&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She had muttered. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy for you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae had exclaimed, hugging her with a bright smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a truly wonderful moment. However, there was one thing Greta wanted to do now that she healed, and when she made this fact clear, it was not taken well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fae, now that I&rsquo;m healed&hellip;could you teach me how to fight like you do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;WHAT?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae exclaimed, her voice shaking the hut with how loud it was. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;...is that a no?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta asked shakily. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;OF COURSE IT IS! You may be healed, but learning how to fight isn&rsquo;t something I can gently teach!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae yelled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta cowered under her glare. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I just wanted to be stronger. I don&rsquo;t want to have to rely on others to save me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She muttered. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip;I can&rsquo;t make you learn fighting, Greta&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae responded with a frown. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared it might aggravate your condition.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She admits. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please? I&rsquo;ll be careful. I want to do this, Fae.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta begs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae sighs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, but don&rsquo;t blame me if something goes wrong.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says, admittedly happy to have someone asking her for guidance. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">An early morning breeze wafted through the ancient trees that overlooked the Bir Tribe village, carrying with it a sense of anticipation. Blonde-haired Greta stood at the edge of a vast training field, rubbing her eyes of their tiredness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Beside her stood Fae, arms on her hips as she looked out into the distance, her forest-green eyes sparkling with excitement. Her long brown hair shimmered in the sunlight, giving her a calm radiance. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, here we are. You ready, Greta?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&rsquo;s heart swelled with trepidation as she nodded eagerly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, please teach me all you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With a knowing smile, Fae led Greta to a small clearing, surrounded by towering trees that seemed to whisper secrets of tradition. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the center of the clearing, they found an assortment of training weapons: a wooden sword, a set of throwing knives, and a beautifully crafted bow and quiver of arrows. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Today, I shall teach you the ancient ways of our people, the art of fighting and hunting monsters. This is a very sacred duty, passed down through generations for those who specifically ask for it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae picked up the wooden sword and handed it to Greta, her voice resonating with an uncharacteristic authority. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The first lesson is to understand your weapon. Feel its weight, notice its balance. Let it become an extension of your mortal body.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta grasps the sword, an unfamiliar surge of energy coursing through her veins. As she swung it tentatively, the movements felt clumsy and awkward. She stumbles, losing her balance and falling to the ground. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae runs to her side. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Woah, don&rsquo;t get ahead of yourself. Before attempting any swings like that, you must allow the blade to accept the energy you&rsquo;re putting into it. You lose balance if you aren&rsquo;t fully in sync.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta nods, coming to her feet with a determined look. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says confidently. Fae nods in approval. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get it, eventually. I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&rsquo;s progress was slow and steady. She stumbled and faltered, frustration gnawing at her conviction. But Fae&rsquo;s unwavering support and encouragement kept her going. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Everyone starts from humble beginnings. True growth arises in those who face these trials with perseverance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She had told her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Over time, Fae slowly introduced Greta to the intricacies of combat techniques&mdash;how to parry, dodge, and strike. Greta&rsquo;s movements were initially hesitant, lacking fluidity and precision, but with every mistake she made, she grew more determined to improve. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She practiced diligently over the course of a week, her swings becoming more controlled, her footwork more deliberate. Each day, she faced mock battles with Fae, simulating all kinds of scenarios. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta would often find herself outmatched, stumbling under her own experience. Fae&rsquo;s strikes were hard, strong, confident, and they hurt with every contact. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But Fae never faltered her belief in Greta&rsquo;s potential. She patiently guided her, offering advice and strategies for all sorts of situations. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Comments such as:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No enemy is the same. Be prepared to adjust your skills for every opponent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Maintain your focus. Don&rsquo;t let the opponent manipulate your movements. You wield the sword, not anyone else.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Agility is important. Hand skill is crucial, but the best fighters are those who move fast on their feet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you get hurt in a fight, don&rsquo;t let the pain control you. You control the pain. Control it until you can&rsquo;t feel a shred of it anymore, and you&rsquo;ll be invincible.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There is no honor in a real world fight. Don&rsquo;t let your opponent bend you into a false sense of security. Always anticipate the use of dirty tricks.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were plenty more. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">In time, Greta&rsquo;s movements </span><span class="c7">became</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;less clumsy, and her strikes held more purpose. She began to anticipate Fae&rsquo;s attacks, countering with newfound confidence. Her growth was gradual, but evident. Failure had been a stepping stone towards her success, and she eventually realized that it was through her many mistakes that she learned the most. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">One misty morning, as Geeta squared off against Fae, a spark ignited within her. She moved with surprising grace, retaliating with a newfound fluidity, and for the first time in her training matches, Greta managed to land a clean hit on Fae&rsquo;s skin. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae&rsquo;s eyes widened, impressed by the transformation before her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Greta&hellip;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She exclaimed, a mix of astonishment and pride in her voice, </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come so far! I can see that your strength is growing, day by day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A smile of triumph tugged at Greta&rsquo;s lips, and a flicker of pride ignited within her. She runs over to Fae and hugs her thankfully. The girl in question flushed at the sudden contact. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all thanks to you&hellip;you&rsquo;re such a good teacher. Thank you so much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta says happily. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae tightens her grasp, pulling her closer. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I should be thanking you. I&rsquo;ve never felt this happy from doing anything, before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She mutters, burying her face in Greta&rsquo;s shoulder. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy, too. I didn&rsquo;t realize just how much I wanted friends until I met you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta says cheerfully. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae&rsquo;s eyes go wide, and she looks to the ground. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Greta&hellip;actually, I&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c18 c11">BWONN!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c11"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her words are suddenly cut off by the sound of a horn. Fae looks up urgently. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta asks worriedly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae frowns. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The Monitu Horn. A signal of extreme danger.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says quickly, grabbing her scabbard and bow and arrow. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stay here, Greta. You might not be able to handle something like this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta shakes her head, grabbing her own sword. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t let you go alone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says confidently. Fae looks hesitant, but sighs and motions for her to follow. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They urgently return to the village, finding everyone scrambling about. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the occasion?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae asks the elder. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He looks to the ground in despair. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;An orc horde was spotted in the valley. One hundred and fifty at least.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta and Fae grimace. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh&hellip;orcs&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae mutters disgustedly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At that moment, several tribe warriors run up to them. A general turns to her, saying: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fae-chi, we&rsquo;re heading out now. We await your command.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae nods, leading them to the borders of the village. Greta follows close behind. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They come to a large valley, normally full of grass and flowers. However, this time it was packed with gross orcs, their moldy green skin glistening in the midday sun. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright everyone! We&rsquo;re going to infiltrate this horde and destroy it before it reaches the village! Your strength has never failed me, and I don&rsquo;t expect it to fail me now! Let us be victorious and march on!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae exclaims. She then turns to Greta, who was staring up at her in awe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You ready for this, Greta?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks. Greta nods. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t learn from the best for nothing, after all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says confidently. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae smiles and then pulls out her sword. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bir Tribe! Onward!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She cries. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A massive battle ensues, resulting in blood spilled on both sides. Village warriors swung swords and shot arrows, killing countless orcs in their path. Orcs carelessly slaughtered those unfortunate enough to be in their sight, their techniques rough and unrefined. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta and Fae fought side by side, slaying many orcs that tried to approach them. Occasionally, Fae stopped to admire Greta&rsquo;s handiwork, complimenting her when the opportunity presented itself. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing good! Keep it up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She would shout. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to tell me that twice!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta would cheekily respond, resulting in laughter from the both of them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The battle seemed to be in their favor, when a loud croaking sound rang over the valley, shaking the ground with its intensity. A massive figure was seen running from the distance, approaching Greta and Fae with callous fury. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Out of the dust that filled the air, came a large orc wearing a bone crown. A chain of skulls hung around his neck, and he wielded an ornate silver sword, which seemed to glow with malice and hatred. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an orc king!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae exclaimed with dread in her eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We have to fight it, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta asked, groaning. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You said it, not me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae sighed, equally annoyed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They prepare their swords, standing on guard facing the king. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He growls at them, shaking the ground again. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He charges towards the two, and the trade blows with it. Small amounts of damage were inflicted, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, the king makes a massive swipe, which knocks Fae off her feet, sending her flying back several feet. Blood dripped from her head as she groaned. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fae!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta cried. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She turned back to the monster, holding her sword with a tight grip, slightly shaking. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The orc king&rsquo;s eyes were full of hatred and he barred his sharp fangs as he stared her down. Roaring once again, he runs at Greta, who dodges and swings at his leg. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The king screams, charging madly in its anger, grabbing Greta with its large clawed hands. She struggled to break free, but it wasn&rsquo;t working. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At that moment, she suddenly remembered something Fae had told her during one of their training matches: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;Oftentimes, the best way to win a fight is to stop and breathe. Clarity triumphs over even the toughest strikes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta closes her eyes and stays still, breathing steadily. All at once, she found the confidence to carry on, the courage to win. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She snaps open her eyes, narrowing them intently, and then grabs the orc king&rsquo;s claws, pulling as hard as she can. The claws snap off, showering blood all over her and causing the king to screech in pain. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It drops her in its agony, allowing Greta to regain her ground. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The orc king roared at her and charged. Greta dodges out of the way and kicks it in the stomach. The king stumbles backwards, and she uses the opportunity to stab her sword into its chest. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With a final cry of pain, the orc king falls to the ground, its foul blood rolling down the valley and stinking the air. The other orcs flee, some being killed by warriors as they run away. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta limps over to Fae and pulls her to her feet. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fae! Are you alright? Fae!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She cries. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae groans and weakly opens her eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Greta&hellip;is it dead?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks wearily. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta nods with a smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The battle is won.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She confirms. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae smiles through tears and hugs her tightly, nuzzling her face in Greta&rsquo;s shoulder. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She mutters. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The villagers around them cheer for their victory, shouting Greta&rsquo;s name in reverence. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A grand feast was held in the village that night, with meat from the orcs, and rare vegetables only used for special occasions. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a wondrous night, yet Greta found very little joy in the festivities. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To her, this day meant something entirely different. Today was actually Kaye&rsquo;s birthday, but unfortunately she wasn&rsquo;t able to celebrate like usual with him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kaye&hellip;I miss you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She muttered woefully. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her sadness was overwhelming, almost hurting her more than any orc ever could. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta looks to the night sky, watching the sparkling stars. Feeling emotional, she begins to sing:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">In this big open world,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">With lots of things to see, </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">It&rsquo;s all nothing to me,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">When I don&rsquo;t have you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">We shared the same life</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">We play the same ways,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">When I first met you,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">You led me astray.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">But when I see your face,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">I know one single thing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">It&rsquo;s hard for me to say, </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">But I can&rsquo;t help but sing:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">My world without you </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">Couldn&rsquo;t be smaller,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">And your place in my heart,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">Couldn&rsquo;t be larger,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">Because in this big old world,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">The one that I love is you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">It was back in old Autumn,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">When my sweet mother died,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">That you came to save me,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">Not once leaving my side.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">All my life I&rsquo;ve come to think,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">Where I&rsquo;d be if you were gone,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">My heart wouldn&rsquo;t take it,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">And I&rsquo;d keep singing this song.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">Because when I see your face,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">I know one single thing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">It&rsquo;s hard for me to say, </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">But I still can&rsquo;t help but sing:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">My world without you </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">Couldn&rsquo;t be smaller,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">And your place in my heart,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">Couldn&rsquo;t be larger,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">Because in this big old world,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">The one that I love is you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">I always say no.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">I always turn away.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">The love that I feel,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">Is so hard to say.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">But the truth is that I,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">Love you more than anything.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">And though I can&rsquo;t speak it,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">I will gladly sing:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">My world without you </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">Couldn&rsquo;t be smaller,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">And your place in my heart,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">Couldn&rsquo;t be larger,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">Because in this big old world,</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">The one I love is you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">The one I love is you.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c8 c11">I love you, Kaye.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c8 c11"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta sighs wistfully, burying her face in her hands.

The walls were etched with delicate patterns, and the entire structure seemed to radiate an otherworldly glow.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen led Kaye into a vast ballroom adorned with glistening stained glass windows. In the center of the room, on the floor, was a huge tray, upon which lay a puzzle made of crystal pieces. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Each fragment reflected the icy brilliance of the surroundings, tempting Kaye with their deceptive beauty.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kaye.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen whispered, her voice like a delicate snowflake landing on his ear. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you can solve this puzzle, I will grant you the power you desire. But be warned, it is deliberately difficult. Only the chosen one can unlock its secrets.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">With those haunting words, the Snow Queen vanished, leaving Kaye alone with the maddening puzzle. Frustration knotted his brow as he tried to fit the crystalline fragments together, but they defied logic and reason. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is so stupid! Give me the power!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">He cried furiously. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">No matter how he turned them or twisted them, the pieces refused to align, mocking his futile efforts.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">In his mounting annoyance, Kaye&#39;s lost focus, his distracted thoughts involuntarily drifting to the Snow Queen. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Images of her regal presence flooded his mind, accompanied by a strange mix of adoration and desire. He yearned for her, not just for the promised power, but for a place by her side, ruling over a world cloaked in ice and darkness.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">A world of beauty.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">As the puzzle taunted him, Kaye&#39;s heart swelled with tender emotions. He adored the Snow Queen for her cruelty, and he couldn&#39;t deny the twisted affection that tugged at his soul. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">After all, he had always loved her since childhood. Right?</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">That was the Snow Queen he loved, right? </span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">There was someone he loved&hellip;</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">But wasn&rsquo;t it the Snow Queen?</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course it is. I love her, she&rsquo;s so wonderful!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">He cried hysterically. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">The mind control had ensnared his mind, blurring the lines between reality and manipulation.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Hours slipped away in a haze of desperation and obsession. Kaye&#39;s frustration grew, fueled by his conflicting emotions. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">With each failed attempt at solving the impossible puzzle, his desire to prove himself to the Snow Queen intensified. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">The alluring promise of power and her enchanting presence dominated his thoughts, drowning out any semblance of reason.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">In the depths of that icy chamber, Kaye wrestled with his mind and his heart, locked in a battle he could not win. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">The crystalline puzzle pieces glimmered before him, symbols of his torment and his longing. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Little did he know that the true power lay not in the puzzle, but within himself, waiting to be untangled from the Snow Queen&#39;s icy grip.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><h3 class="c19" id="h.9l014wu80dbh"><span class="c16">X: Her Capital Visit</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When Greta woke up the third morning after her celebration feast, she had only one thing in mind: Kaye. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She honestly hadn&rsquo;t thought about him in a while, being distracted by her fun experiences with Fae and the rest of the village people. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But now three months had passed since she entered the Rotted Elms, and she yearned for his presence. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta walked out of her hut and stood at the door, taking in the morning sunlight as it casted a golden hue over the village.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She knew she couldn&rsquo;t stay here forever. Especially if Kaye was still out there, waiting to be found. But at the same time&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She didn&rsquo;t want to leave.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The surroundings of Bir Village were beautiful, soothing, and calm. The people that she came to live with were friendly, nice, and sympathetic. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta blushed as she looked to the ground. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She didn&rsquo;t want to be away from Fae. They were so close now, so happy in each other&rsquo;s company. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But now that the time to depart was approaching, she might have to leave her behind. It wasn&rsquo;t like she could bring her along, right? Fae had family here&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta frowns and returns to her hut somberly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take her away from her family&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She mutters, grabbing her backpack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have to leave before she sees me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta scrambles around the hut, gathering various items she deemed necessary for her travels. With every item, memories came to mind, flooding her with a bout of emotions. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She tried her best to ignore the tears rolling down her face. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Now at the outskirts of the village, Greta took a deep breath and looked out into the great beyond. Uncharted territory was waiting for her, but she was stronger now, and more confident in herself. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She turns around one last time, ingraining the visage of the Bir Tribe in her mind before she left it forever. Her eyes began to water, but she wiped her face quickly to hide it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Keep it together, Greta.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta patted herself on the chest, knocking any emotion out of her before it could wreck her concentration. She looks back to the far unknown, closes her eyes, and allows nature to take hold. The sounds of the forest give her zen and provide the strength she needs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She pulls her backpack over her shoulders, ready for new travels. The time was now. There was no going back. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But just as she was about to take the first step&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&hellip;a familiar voice called out from behind her. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Going somewhere?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta froze, slowly turning around with dread in her eyes. There she saw Fae standing with her arms crossed, a frown on her face. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Guilt overtook her. She knew leaving without saying farewell was a cruel choice. She knew Fae would be upset with her. But there wasn&rsquo;t anything she could do about it. This had to be done. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to worry you, but I must leave. I have to find Kaye, and I have to do it alone. I can&rsquo;t bring you into my troubles.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She hesitantly explained. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae&rsquo;s eyes welled up with tears, before she suddenly hugged Greta forcefully. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You dummy! We&rsquo;ve been through so much together and you choose to leave me behind? Why don&rsquo;t you consider how I feel about this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta frowns.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But&hellip;your family is here&hellip;I can&rsquo;t just separate you from them for my own selfish quest&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She mutters. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae looks to the ground. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Is that what you told my mother? Is that what you told the</span><span class="c7 c17">&nbsp;village elder</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks angrily. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wha&ndash; how do you know about that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta asks in surprise. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I overheard. You really told everyone else besides me, didn&rsquo;t you? Do you realize how much that hurts?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae responds. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta frowns. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. It&rsquo;s too late for you to come with me. If you go to tell anyone, I won&rsquo;t wait. If you go to bring equipment, I still won&rsquo;t wait. Please stay in the village, for your sake.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says quietly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae doesn&rsquo;t respond for a few seconds. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fae?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta asks worriedly. Did she say too much? Was that too harsh? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Fae begins to chuckle. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t want me to come, then you should have said so earlier.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta asks, confused. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae motions upwards with her hand. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alfar!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She cries. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">An orange blur drops down in front of them, carrying a backpack in its mouth. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mabter, I habe brogh your stubf.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alfar the fox says stuffily. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae says, grabbing her backpack and wrapping it around her shoulders. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fae&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta immediately understood her motives. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae snaps, determined to gain Greta&rsquo;s admission.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But&hellip;the village&hellip;your people&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta mutters. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I already asked for their blessing. They&rsquo;re okay with me accompanying you. Please, Greta, I want to be by your side. It hurts me to be away from you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae begs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&rsquo;s resolve wavered, blushing from Fae&rsquo;s honest words and unchanging loyalty. She realized at this moment that she didn&rsquo;t have to bear her weight alone. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Truth be told, she secretly wanted Fae to come with her all along. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, if you&rsquo;re willing to come with me&hellip;then let&rsquo;s embark together.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says with a tender smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae smiles in return, saddling up close with a pep in her step. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She laughs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A little ways down the valley&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh, I&rsquo;m so hungry!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A certain fox whined loudly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta looked over at Alfar, who was currently on Fae&rsquo;s shoulders, with an annoyed glare. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Did we </span><span class="c7 c17">really</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;need to bring this guy along?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks, sighing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae frowns. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That was the one stipulation that my mother requested.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says with a resigned expression. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, I can hear you two talking about me down there!

Do you ever stop talking?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta asks in exasperation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, excuse me! I, for the record, don&rsquo;t like you either! You&rsquo;ve stolen my spot! You&rsquo;ll never take away my role as master&rsquo;s best sidekick!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alfar snaps. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae shakes her head. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Was there ever a title like that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks with a sigh. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&ldquo;I just </span><span class="c7">made it one</span><span class="c0">!

With a yoink, Alfar yelps loudly and scurries from her shoulders, shaking furiously. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;H-hey! Y-you&hellip;m-master! W-why did y-you do t-that?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He asks in fear. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hm&hellip;I wonder why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae teasingly asks.

He looks like he&#39;s d-dying, now&hellip;pfft!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She laughs, barely containing her laughter. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">From that point, Alfar hardly said a word. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The trio of cheerful girls and a sad fox found themselves outside the edges of the Rotted Elms, as noted by Greta&rsquo;s map. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A massive river greeted them, flowing at a speed too fast to cross normally, and too turbulent for any sailing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But as residents of the Bir Tribe, Greta and Fae had no trouble making it to the other side. They hadn&rsquo;t trained for months for nothing, after all. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was by the trees that they traveled, swinging and jumping to various branches that grew over the river. What should have been a normal challenge was over in a flash. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Other obstacles greeted them as they traveled, like more orcs, a few goblins, and even a couple of vultures. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Naturally, those monsters were all dead rather quickly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">They </span><span class="c7">served as lunch</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and dinner for the often hungry trio. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The forestal wilderness now behind them, Greta and Fae found themselves in what initially seemed to be a formation of rocks and stone. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;These formations are strange&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae muttered as she noted their shape and height. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This can&rsquo;t be natural, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta asked, having a few suspicions. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That was when they realized that this place wasn&rsquo;t a work of nature. It was a very old set of ruins, overgrown with thick moss. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ruins&hellip;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae exclaimed in awe. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So cool!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta giggled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re excited.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says with a smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this before! I want to know more about it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae eagerly said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They explored the ruins for a while, finding various remnants of the past, like old tiles, faded pottery, and ripped paintings. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Look there!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae suddenly cried, pointing into the distance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta ran over, curious to see. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks, peering out to where she pointed. Her eyes go wide. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A massive castle was visible in the land beyond, surrounded by tall stone walls. Thousands of small cottages lined the path to this castle, each accented with exotic flowers and fruit trees. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta was in total awe at the grand scale of everything before her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That must be&hellip;the capital&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She mutters. Fae&rsquo;s eyes light up like stars as she visibly bounces in place. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I want to see! I want to see!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She cries. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta smiles and takes her hand. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let us go then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says. Fae nods. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The trio head away from the ruins, finding themselves heading down a steep valley that seemed to be drawing them downward. They nearly lost their balance a few times, but made it in the end. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A tall wooden archway greeted them, painted with the words:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c17">&ldquo;Welcome to Cordenia, the capital of the free world!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They passed by the rows of cottages, in awe at the sheer scale of everything. Their route took them down a long, winding brick path, leading up to a massive stone archway, decorated with ornate blue tiles and gold trim, nearly double the size of the previous one they walked through. Huge stone walls extended on each side, adorned with enormous blue banners that contained a seal of arms. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">All at once, Greta and Fae were greeted with a sensory overload of anticipation and excitement. A stupendous amount of stalls and booths lined various avenues, showcasing a myriad of wares and delicacies. The scent of freshly baked pastries and roasted meats wafted through the air, mingling with the joyous laughter of revelers, large groups of which filled the streets all around, leaving the air feeling claustrophobic. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta and Fae didn&rsquo;t know where to look, their eyes being drawn in multiple directions. As merry individuals passed by them, Greta stopped someone to ask: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Excuse me, but&hellip;what exactly is going on?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why, today&rsquo;s the Festival of Unity! Every 20 years, the capital celebrates the anniversary of our great country!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The passerby responds. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Festival&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta turns to Fae, noticing her excited eyes and eagerness. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">She looks to the ground, slightly envious of her elation. </span><span class="c7 c17">Her</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;mind was divided between the jubilant atmosphere and her search for Kaye. She wanted to explore everything as well, but the main reason she came all this way was to find the one she loved. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Greta, are you okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae asked worriedly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta smiled to dissuade her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m just unsure&hellip;I want to enjoy this festival, but&hellip;I also have to find Kaye&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says with a sigh. Fae smiles in understanding. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t we do both?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She suggests. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&rsquo;s eyes go wide, and then chuckles at her own ignorance. She could always count on Fae to make her see how complicated she was making things. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know&hellip;you really have a way of coming up with things I would have never considered.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae looks to the ground and then pulls Greta close to her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s selfish of me to say this, but&hellip;no matter what leads we find on Kaye, I want us to enjoy this festival together, okay?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She mutters. Greta blushes and then nods. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hand in hand, Greta and Fae made their way through the bustling streets, their hearts brimming with excitement. All around, stalls were beckoning them forth, asking for their attention. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They stopped to enjoy skewers, lined with fruit that gave off enchanted flavors in their mouths. They tried buttery cookies that filled them with warmth and softness. They shared a drink made from rare and exotic fruits, which calmed them with radiating, soothing energy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Various vendors offered trinkets and toys, which made them marvel in awe and pure wonder. Seamstresses dressed them up in lovely white dresses, worth very little at extreme discounts. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae stopped at a stall full of fine jewelry, staring intently at a beautiful necklace which seemed to call her name. Greta noticed this and smiled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Excuse me, sir, but can I purchase that crystal necklace there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">She asks, causing </span><span class="c7">Fae</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to stare at her with a surprised look. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, you can! That&rsquo;ll be two gold coins.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The vendor responds. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta hands him the proper payment, a quarter of her savings from Wilfonde, and accepts the necklace with gentle hands. She turns to Fae, who was looking at her in confusion. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fae, turn around for me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She whispers. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae blushes, understanding her intentions, and obliges the request. Greta wraps the necklace around her neck, feeling flushed at the sight of her bare skin. She hooks it firmly together and smiles. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You can face me now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae faces her once more and looks down at the necklace on her chest. She nearly cries. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to&hellip;buy this&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She mutters, a little happy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta shakes her head. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But you wanted it, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae begrudgingly nods. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;T-thank you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She murmurs. Greta chuckles at her awkwardness. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Filled with renewed purpose, the two friends continued their exploration of the festival. They marveled at the grand parades, with floats adorned with dazzling displays of magic and mythological creatures dancing alongside. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the sun dipped below the horizon, bathing the city in a warm, golden glow, Greta and Fae found themselves at the heart of the festival. The central square was a spectacle of lights and colors, as people from all walks of life gathered to celebrate the unity of Cordenia. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Performers twirled with grace, fire dancers spun flames in mesmerizing patterns, and jugglers amazed the crowd with their dexterity. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Amidst the merriment, Greta seized every opportunity to inquire about Kaye. She approached stall vendors, street performers, and wise storytellers, sharing his description and asking for any information they might have. Though the answers were often vague and conflicting, she refused to lose hope.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The day grew closer to its end, as musicians filled the air with the sound of melodies that resonated deep within. There were many different songs to finish the festival, some cheerful and uplifting, others haunting and melancholic. Then started a slow amorous serenade, as many couples began to dance and flourish in the streets. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Greta and Fae eyed each other, blushing as they did so. Unconsciously locking hands, they found themselves dancing along to the music, both their hearts swelling with untold emotions. In that moment, they felt a sense of tender belonging and sentimentalism with each other, but neither dared to break the fervent silence by bringing it up. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c7">The music seemed to guide their movements, </span><span class="c7">pitting</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;them in a battle, not of fighting strength, but of mental fortitude. Who would manage to keep their feelings in check for long enough until the musicians stopped playing? </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Fae glanced at Greta, her face turning red. As her eyes locked with the blonde girl&rsquo;s own, a single thought came to her mind:</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c7 c17">I love you.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c7">As the last </span><span class="c7">embers</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of the festival faded, Greta and Fae set forth under the starlit sky, their hearts unknowingly intertwined with each other. Greta knew she hadn&rsquo;t yet achieved her goal of finding Kaye, that was for certain, but she didn&rsquo;t really care. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Their dance made everything worth it in her eyes. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">But deep down, she did feel upset that no one had any information about her cause. The more she thought about it, the more guilty she felt. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">No, she couldn&rsquo;t let the festival distract her, she couldn&rsquo;t let her emotions distract her, no matter how good they were.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">She needed to focus on the subject at hand. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Greta, are you okay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Fae asked suddenly, startling her. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;m fine. I just&hellip;I realized that I haven&#39;t really tried my best to find Kaye, today. I&rsquo;ve been too distracted by the festival, the music, the&hellip;everything else&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">She says with a sigh. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Fae frowns guilty. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry, I got us distracted.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">She admits. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t your fault, I was the one who kept getting carried away. If I had just focused, I could have asked more people&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Greta says. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">They both look to the ground with guilty looks. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, a large group of promiscuous-looking women walk past them, talking loudly in their wake. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Why </span><span class="c7">madame</span><span class="c0">, you look absolutely stunning, this evening!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course, the Prince is hosting his Unity Festival banquet tonight! I must look my best for him!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, the Prince! Isn&rsquo;t he simply wonderful?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, with his splendidly fair skin, he&rsquo;s quite devine!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, and what I wouldn&rsquo;t give to have that beautiful auburn hair of his!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Those clothes he wears are also always so finely made, I would love to have his tailor!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;His Princess is very fittingly lovely as well!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The Prince is simply the best!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta overheard the lascivious young women&rsquo;s conversation and latched onto what they said about auburn hair. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A Prince with &lsquo;auburn hair&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, that could describe many Princes, but Kaye&rsquo;s hair was similar to that color, and he was taken by a queen. Maybe this Prince was Kaye himself?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Greta, what is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae asks. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I think I just got a lead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Greta responds, eyeing the jaunty young women with a grin. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><h3 class="c19" id="h.khvcyav761j7"><span class="c16">XI: Their Irreplaceable Kindness (and how to break it)</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uh, Greta, are you sure this is a good idea?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae asked, as they sneakily approached the capital castle. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have to know if Kaye is in there. Some queen might have stolen him to make him a Prince!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta responds. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Would the rulers of this country </span><span class="c7 c17">really</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;kidnap a random little boy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alfar asks from Fae&rsquo;s shoulders. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Welcome back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae says with a malicious grin. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;J-just voicing my opinion!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alfar shakily defends. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Under the cover of darkness, Greta and Fae slipped past the guards stationed at the gate, their breath held in nervousness. The castle loomed before them, an imposing structure with tall turrets that seemed to touch the heavens. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With every step, their trepidation threatened to consume any better judgment they might have had. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As they crept amongst the shadows, Greta&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat when she saw the grand hall ablaze with light and merriment. The Festival of Unity was still in full swing here, not at all hampered by the coming of night. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The scent of sumptuous delicacies and pastries wafted through the air, tempting their already-full stomachs with promises of apt deliciousness. They couldn&rsquo;t help but let their eyes wander, marveling at the resplendent decorations and the elegant guests.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The outside festival had certainly been a wonder on its own, but the flourishments of the castle were on an entirely different level altogether. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Large rows of tables lined the floor, laden with exquisite and exotic dishes, many that Greta and Fae had never seen before. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">All around the tables were high class noblemen and women, dressed to the tee in expensive suits and pricey dresses. The two young girls in cheaper white dresses felt underdressed for the occasion. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But they couldn&rsquo;t let themselves get distracted like last time. Fae was a little eager to explore, but she held in her excitement for the sake of Greta&rsquo;s mission. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Taking a deep breath, they covertly slipped into the hall, careful not to draw attention to themselves. The air hummed with the melodies of laughter and cheerful conversation, but Greta&rsquo;s focused eyes darted frantically, searching for a familiar face. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Within a few seconds, she locked eyes with the Prince, who sat at the end of the long tables in an ornately royal chair that befitted his position. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Though she couldn&rsquo;t fully make out his face from the distance she was at, Greta felt that this was the boy she had been looking for. She felt that she had found Kaye. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta said, staring at the Prince with hopeful eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? Clearly he isn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alfar tries to say, but Greta cuts him off. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She exclaims. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Greta, I really think you should reconsider&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae starts to advise, but Greta ignores her and abandons all attempts at secrecy, running out into the banquet in her fervor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait, Greta&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Unfortunately, Fae could do very little, as Greta had already reached the end of the table in her eagerness. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kaye&mdash;&rdquo; She started excitedly. But the auburn haired boy who stood before her was not the boy she had come to love. Greta&rsquo;s heart sank. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae shook her head in exasperation. Alfar grimaces from her shoulders.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We tried to warn her&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He sighs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta was frozen in shame, unsure of what to say. The Prince stood up, tilting his head in confusion at the situation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Little miss, is there a reason for this interruption?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He asks. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta starts hesitantly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, are you in need of something, little one?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A girl, who was undoubtedly the Princess, asked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta bows her head apologetically.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, I was under the impression that my dear friend was here, but it appears that I am sorely mistaken.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Prince and the Princess look at her with sympathy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve lost your friend? How dreadful! Where did you travel from?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Princess asks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta frowns in reminiscence. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We lived in the town of Wilfonde, past the Rotted Elms.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She mutters. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Their eyes go wide in surprise. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Past the Elms?!

None of them have come back from that horrible castle.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Despite their grim words, Greta perks up, finally having the lead she wanted. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know where she is?&rdquo; She asks, hopeful. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Prince frowns. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We do, but&hellip;little miss, the snow queen is no simple foe to face.

Silently, Greta and Fae made their way through the shadowed corridors, avoiding the watchful eyes of the guards. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They were lucky that most of the inhabitants of the castle were either drunk or tired from the recent festivities, because they most certainly would have been spotted. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Their quiet steps took them to the horse stables, where several beautiful breeds were sleeping and/or resting. Greta hesitated as she entered, the scent of hay and leather reaching her nose. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her heart ached, guilty at what she was doing to the prince and princess&rsquo; trust. She turned to Fae, frowning. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are we really doing the right thing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She whispered, her voice laced with uncertainty. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae placed a hand on her shoulder encouragingly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You want to save Kaye, don&rsquo;t you?

Unfortunately, they had been a little too loud when doing this, as the two horses woke up soon after. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18 c21"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hah?!

Unfortunately, there was nothing they could do to stop it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Instead, they decided to focus on the road ahead, which was most likely full of uncertainties and coming dangers. Their surroundings were growing less and less vibrant, more and more lifeless. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meadows littered with flowers were frozen in place, like a time capsule of another era. Trees were dead and frozen to their core, teetering on the brink of falling to pieces with the slightest touch. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were no monsters that attacked them, but that wasn&rsquo;t reassuring in any way. It just further emphasized how dead the environment had become. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Snow then seemed to fly out of the shadows, pelting them with childish hits. Being that they only wore white lace dresses, Greta and Fae were growing cold where they sat. Their shoulders were clearly shaking amongst the freezing air. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I-it&rsquo;s&hellip;c-cold&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta muttered through gritted teeth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae nodded in agreement. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;W-we s-should have c-changed&hellip;b-before we l-left&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You get what you deserve!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rol exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I hope you freeze to death!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Bern sneers. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta and Fae don&rsquo;t even respond to their scathing remarks. They really didn&rsquo;t care anymore. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, they found themselves at a massive pond, which was frozen over completely. The flora around it was dead beyond healing, and it was clear that a dark aura was emanating from the area. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta and Fae glanced at each other, nodded, and then carefully led their horses onto the slippery ice. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, what are you fools doing?! Turn us back! You&rsquo;ll kill us all!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rol and Bern cried. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta and Fae were determined to get across the perilous predicament, though, and continued on their way despite the obvious warning signs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The wintry landscape glistened with a strange beauty, despite the deadness of the trees, or the magical air that seemed to wash over them. Greta&rsquo;s eyes widened as they ventured forward, seeing a tall white castle in the distance, its spires reaching towards the heavens. Her heart began to beat fast as she hoped for a miracle. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says, her breath visible in the cold air. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae turned to her, doubt clear in her face. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A-are you sure?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta nods confidently. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been more sure.

Dread set in, and fear came soon after, as the ice began to groan, splitting beneath their weight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rol and Bern screamed in panic, throwing them off in an attempt to escape. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You fools! You should have known this would happen!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rol cried. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re leaving you miserable idiots to rot!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Bern exclaimed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that, they now had no horses, and a frozen pond threatening to break beneath their feet. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta and Fae glanced at each other, scared out of their wits. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;W-what should we do?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta asked in fright. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&hellip;uh&hellip;we run!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae cried, grabbing her hand and quickly scurrying across the cracking ice. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, their haste proved disastrous. With a deafening crash, the ice beneath them shattered, plunging them into the icy depths. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&rsquo;s heart raced as she fought against the numbing cold, her body aching with the shock of the freezing water. The senses in her body felt overwhelmed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But just as darkness threatened to take hold, ethereal figures emerged from depths of the frozen pond. Ice spirits, with bodies vaguely resembling humans, jaws as sharp as nails, and icy breath, surrounded Greta and Fae, their eyes glinting with malevolence. They hissed and whispered, their presence casting sinister tones over the water. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae&rsquo;s instincts kicked in, and with a flash, she unsheathed her blade and positioned herself in front of Greta. Her movements were swift and agile, her sword slicing through the spirits, but their form only flickered, and their assault continued soon afterward. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae grimaced, then glanced at a worried Greta. She smiles sadly, coming to a decision she knew she couldn&rsquo;t take back. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Greta, go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She cried. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta&rsquo;s eyes go wide. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? No, I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She refuses. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You have to! Kaye is waiting for you! Go save him! I&rsquo;ll be alright, so please&hellip;just go&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta hesitated, torn between her loyalty to Fae and her determination to rescue Kaye. Her heart ached with the weight of the conundrum, but she knew Fae could stand her ground in a fight. She looked back at her one last time, tears threatening to fall as she silently said: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7 c17">Thank you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fae watched as Greta swam away, having mustered her courage and broken free from the entanglement of the frozen pond. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tears rolled down her eyes as she whispered softly:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I love you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And with that final cry, she turned back to the spirits and readied her sword. This would be a tough fight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta splashed out of the water, breathing heavily in the cold, freezing air. Her soaked dress clung to her like a second skin, her limbs numb and heavy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen&rsquo;s castle loomed closer, a beacon of meager hope amidst the turmoil. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Every step felt like an eternity as Greta pushed forward, her vision suddenly clouded by a swirling blizzard that started to whip around her. The wind howled like a mournful cry, but she pressed on, driven by the knowledge that her best friend had sacrificed herself for the quest to succeed.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">As the castle drew nearer, Greta&#39;s breaths came in ragged gasps, her body aching with exhaustion. Yet, she refused to yield. Her love for Kaye propelled her forward, her memories with Fae gave her courage, and together they granted her the strength to overcome the icy trials that beset her.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">With one final burst of determination, Greta reached the castle gates, her frozen shaking hands reaching the cold metal handles that lay above. She prayed that her arrival would herald a chance to save Kaye, and see his smiling face again.</span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">Greta weakly grabbed both of the aging metal handles and pulled them as hard as she could. The wooden gates creaked open, and she stepped into the unknown, her heart filled with trepidation and unyielding courage. </span></p><p class="c13 c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13 c2"><span class="c0">She thought back to Fae and held a hand over her chest, hoping, praying, her sacrifice wouldn&rsquo;t be for nothing. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><h3 class="c19" id="h.tsyq45evaxln"><span class="c16">XII: His Love, Reunited</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The interior of the Snow Queen&rsquo;s castle was impressive, to say the least. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Beautiful blue mosaics lined the floors, accented with bright jewels and crystals. Blue tapestry adorned the walls, slightly aging due to time. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Passageways extended in various directions, leading who knows where, but Greta continued forward, not wanting to get lost. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kaye?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She whispered, hoping for a response. None came. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A little discouraged, she kept going. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After walking for what felt like hours, Greta found herself in a massive ballroom, surrounded by stained glass windows and expensive marble. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But Greta wasn&rsquo;t admiring the scenery. Her eyes were locked onto the figure that sat on the floor, surrounded by large glass puzzle pieces.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her eyes began to water as she slowly approached with a wry smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kaye&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She called, wrapping her arms around him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kaye! Kaye! Aaaah!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For the first time since childhood, Greta sobbed like a little girl, shaking Kaye desperately as she did so. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye looks up at her, not with happiness or excitement, but with pure disgust. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh, it&rsquo;s you. How did you find me, wench?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He asks rudely. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta doesn&rsquo;t let this bother her though. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I traveled all across the land for you, Kaye.

Get out of my sight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye snaps. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta nuzzles his cheek, getting him wet with tears as she did so. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I won&#39;t. I&rsquo;ll stay here until you become good again, Kaye.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says confidently. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tch. Why would I become good? There&rsquo;s no need for that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye says coldly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please, Kaye. I love you so much. It hurts me to hear these words you say, because I know you don&rsquo;t mean them. Please come back to me.

Her sobbing tears were longer full of happiness, but now they were sad. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kaye, I&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She looks to the ground, unsure of what to say. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then she closed her eyes, and began a calm melody&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Softly, the words come falling out, her voice weak, but her emotion strong. Her song for Kaye that Fae had heard was now all she had left to save him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her song carried all through the castle halls, filling the ballroom with a warm glow and calm aura.

They were so caught up in their emotions, that they didn&rsquo;t notice a tiny little shard of glass that fell with Kaye&rsquo;s tears, the source of his evil. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta looked Kaye in the eyes and smiled wryly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I love you. I always have.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She finally admits. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kaye&rsquo;s eyes go wide as his face turns red. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He smiles embarrassedly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I love you, too, Greta.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He also admits. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They stare at each other for a minute, feeling that there was something they wanted to do. Slowly, they brought their faces closer together, romantically attempting to close the distance&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&hellip;but unfortunately, their tender moment was very short lived. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, well, well. Here you are, at last!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A loud booming voice says, filling the halls of the castle with reverberation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta hides Kaye behind her, looking around frantically. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where are you? I know that&rsquo;s you, Snow Queen!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She shouts. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen laughs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The little girl protects the little boy? How charming.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says coldly from behind them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta quickly turns around, seeing the Snow Queen sneering at her with joy in her eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve finally arrived in my midst. I was wondering when you&rsquo;d show up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen says. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta and Kaye slowly back up, but the door behind them freezes shut. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Did you think I would let you go </span><span class="c7 c17">that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;easily?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks, grinning. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you want from us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta asks nervously. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen smiles. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why, I only want your power.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She explains. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Our power? You&rsquo;d kidnap innocent children, for some stupid power?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta asks angrily. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen simply nods. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. I care nothing for the trappings of little boys, nor the cries of worthless little girls. All I want is the magical energy they hold. The desperation, the sadness, the confidence. It all gives them such wonderful power!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She exclaims manically. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta glares at her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You evil witch! I won&rsquo;t let you have Kaye! No way in hell!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She yells furiously. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But the Snow Queen was not phased. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Such delightful confidence and courage. Your power will be great when I harness it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She says in amusement, casting powerful magic with her hands that binds both Greta and Kaye. She forces them to the ground, standing over them with a malicious grin. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You children aren&rsquo;t deserving of the power you have. When I have enough of it, I&rsquo;ll turn this miserable world into a winter wonderland!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She exclaims. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta glares at her, shakes vigorously, and then closes her fists with determination, before standing with difficulty. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You dare?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen yells in anger. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta smiles. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you hurt us again! I won&rsquo;t let you hurt anyone again!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She pulls out her magic sword, breaking the magic force field around her. She then stands and faces the Snow Queen, ready to fight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, there it is. How many girls have I seen pull this move? And how many survived it? None.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen mutters, forming two swords with her magic. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Come and face me, but know that you&rsquo;ll never stand a chance!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta takes a deep breath, and then charges forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A massive sword fight between her and the Snow Queen occurs, creating a spectacle that Kaye can only watch with wide eyes. He was a little confused about why Greta knew sword fighting techniques, but seeing her that way just made him fall in love with her even more. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta herself was recalling all the lessons that Fae had taught her, trying to contain her tears. She couldn&rsquo;t let that training go to waste.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You fight nicely. Quite a difference from the others who came this way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen compliments. She wasn&rsquo;t beyond recognizing talent, after all. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta grits her teeth. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was taught well by a skilled fighter who was my best friend! She sacrificed herself so that I could end you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She exclaims. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly realization hits the Snow Queen, and she begins to smile widely. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Oh, you mean&hellip;</span><span class="c7 c17">this best friend</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She sneers, snapping her fingers. A frozen block of ice appears from one of the stained glass windows, and Greta&rsquo;s eyes go wide in shock. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;F-Fae!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She cries, spotting the familiar brown-haired frozen within the ice. The Snow Queen laughs at her reaction. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s a really sad sight, huh? You can&rsquo;t swim in that lake and expect to survive the spirits. They are very loyal to me. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll use her power after I kill you both.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She grins. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Fury built up within Greta, and she suddenly swung madly at the Snow Queen, striking whenever she could. Unfortunately, her wild anger was overriding her concentration and movements, causing her to strike less and get hit more. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen suddenly slashes her sword with a speed that Greta isn&rsquo;t expecting. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c18"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c18 c11">Skkrish! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The blades of her swords went straight through her arm. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta held her right arm in anguish, wincing at the extraordinary pain. She could feel blood trickling through her fingers, and the sight of red made her a little faint. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah&hellip;Ah&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She whimpered. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen laughs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Strong. But not strong enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She mocked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta gritted her teeth, her rage was building, and suddenly her mind flashed back to what Fae told her before: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let the pain control you, you control the pain. Control it until you can&rsquo;t feel a sliver of it anymore.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta sucked in as much air as she could and held her sword out firmly. She could see the cracks forming, the signs of breaking, but she stood firm, her eyes focused. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c7">Be with me, Fae. I will save both you and Kaye. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen&rsquo;s patience was waning, her smiles fading. She glares at Greta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So you still try to fight. Very well!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen strikes at her, the force of her swords stronger than ever. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta stood her ground, but could feel her hands shaking, her sword bending. Sweat formed on her brow, she groaned as she tried with all her might and strength to hold back. But there was nothing she could do. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Crack!</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With one final hit from the Snow Queen&rsquo;s Sword, Greta&rsquo;s blade shattered into a million pieces, sending magic dust everywhere. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The force of the attack sends Greta backwards into a wall, causing her to cry out in pain. Kaye looks on worriedly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Greta&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Greta wearily stands up and holds her chest, groaning. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Agh&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She nearly stumbles. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Snow Queen smiles triumphantly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, your sword is shattered, your flesh has been cut. Do you believe you stand a chance against me?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She asks, and then she grabs Greta with magic, pulling her towards her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Since you resisted me so much, I will make your death as painful as possible. Goodbye, foolish girl!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She cries, and then summons swaths of white-colored magic, which hits Greta, causing her to scream out in pain and agony. Her skin turned pale, ice began to form around her body, and she started squirming and moaning shrilly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stop!
