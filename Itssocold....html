A kotatsu sat in the middle of the living room, having been set up in obvious haste. Beneath it, two close friends&mdash;Ayumi and Haruki&mdash;shared a pot of freshly brewed tea, enjoying a rare bit of peace together. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">College had been merciless that semester, with exams, deadlines, and time-consuming jobs pulling them in opposing directions. Their shared Christmas tradition of sitting under the kotatsu and doing absolutely nothing had been a lifeline they clung to, a moment to relax and remember the friendship they developed ever since middle school. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aah&hellip; another Christmas alone&hellip;&rdquo; Ayumi sighed dramatically, laying her head on the kotatsu&rsquo;s surface. Her voice carried a mock sadness, but her eyes twinkled mischievously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Haruki, ever used to her teases, raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;And what am I? A ghost?&rdquo; he quipped, his voice dry but tinged with humor.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; Ayumi replied airily, her hand waving as if to dismiss his presence altogether. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t count.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good to know I rank somewhere below&hellip;&rdquo; He paused, as though searching for the most insulting comparison. &ldquo;&hellip;a plate of takoyaki?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;A </span><span class="c6">good</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;plate of takoyaki,&rdquo; she corrected, a grin tugging at her lips. She always loved teasing him&mdash;he always made it easy and never hesitated to play along.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Haruki chuckled, shaking his head. &ldquo;Careful, Ayumi. You might freeze to death without your precious takoyaki.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so cold&hellip;&rdquo; she muttered, ignoring his jab as she pulled the kotatsu blanket tighter around her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The kotatsu is on max heat,&rdquo; he pointed out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still freezing!&rdquo; she exclaimed, casting a deliberately pitiful look his way. She even rubbed her arms for effect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Try changing the thermostat,&rdquo; he suggested, though he clearly had no intention of moving to do it himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get up,&rdquo; she whined, her eyes narrowing at him accusingly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ll just freeze then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so mean!&rdquo; she said, giving him a playful kick with her foot under the table. &ldquo;Plus, there are other ways to get warm&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh really?&rdquo; he asked, his tone knowing. He leaned slightly toward her, an amused expression playing on his face. &ldquo;Lay them on me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ayumi didn&rsquo;t hesitate. She scooted over, closed the distance between them, and kissed him deeply. It was the kind of kiss that said everything they&rsquo;d been too stubborn to put into words for years. When she finally pulled back, her cheeks were flushed, but her eyes held steady on his. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s warm up together?&rdquo; she murmured, a hint of embarrassment in her voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Haruki blinked, his composure slipping for just a moment. Then, with a smirk that matched hers, he nodded. &ldquo;That was very sly,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ve got no choice.&rdquo;</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Though it took a lot of effort on their part, they removed all of their clothes under the kotatsu. The whole world seemed to disappear beneath the white tablecloth, and as the air grew warmer, the kisses grew more intimate and breathless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know, I feel like this defeats the purpose of warming up,&rdquo; Haruki said, though he was already lost in the act of caressing her body. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ayumi&rsquo;s breath hitched at his touch, but she still managed to quip, &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what you think, then why did you remove my underwear so quickly?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s inclination,&rdquo; he replied with a grin, his fingers brushing between her legs in a way that made her moan and glare at him all at once.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That was too sudden!&rdquo; she exclaimed, though the corners of her mouth twitched upward. &ldquo;Maybe warn me next time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Funny,&rdquo; Haruki chuckled. &ldquo;You say this every single time we do it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ayumi shot back by reaching between his legs. &ldquo;And I wonder whose fault that is?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For about an hour they acted on their inclinations, bantering with each other the whole time. To others, it might not seem like the most romantic lovemaking, but for them it was entirely within their nature. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sappy words didn&rsquo;t even need to be spoken; every glance, tease, and touch conveyed everything they wanted to say. </span></p><hr><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When it was over, they laid under the kotatsu, their bare, exhausted bodies tightly intertwined. All traces of cold had vanished, replaced with the warmth that came from the closeness they shared. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s too hot,&rdquo; Ayumi groaned, her forehead resting against his shoulder. Despite her complaint, her hand remained firmly locked in his, their fingers still laced together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh, and I&rsquo;m tired&hellip;&rdquo; Haruki yawned, his voice laced with the contentment that usually resulted after such a physical act.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But you have to admit&hellip; that was pretty nice,&rdquo; Ayumi said softly, her voice losing some of its usual teasing edge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Haruki agreed, his lips curving into a smile as he stared up at the ceiling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For a moment, the room was silent except for the faint hum of the kotatsu and the occasional soft whistle of wind outside. Then, Ayumi spoke again, breaking the quiet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey&hellip; do you mind if I stay over?&rdquo; she asked, her voice shy for the first time that evening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an extra futon in the closet,&rdquo; he replied casually, though the faint blush creeping up his neck betrayed him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve prepared for this?&rdquo; she teased, her confidence returning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Says the one with plan B in her purse,&rdquo; he shot back without missing a beat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ayumi laughed, a soft, genuine sound that filled the room. &ldquo;Touch&eacute;.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They kissed again, this time slower, savoring the moment. Outside, the world grew colder, but inside, under the kotatsu, everything was warm and exactly as it should be.</span></p><p class="c3 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
