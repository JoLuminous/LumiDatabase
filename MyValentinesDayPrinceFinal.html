And yet she was.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There was certainly precedent for it, of course. She was insanely smart, and possessed an athletic strength that no one could possibly hope to tangle with. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It was surely hard to believe that a ten year old girl held such traits. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Coupled alongside her amicable, yet firm, personality, Nanami was the kind of person everyone wanted to be friends with. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But that was to her absolute detriment. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">See, for as many admirers and supposed friends she had, a good majority of them were only near her because of the connections. How great it would be, to say you were friends with the girl who was considered the queen of her elementary school! </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami probably only had two close friends who were by her side for personal reasons, rather than artificial ones. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Worst of all, it seemed Nanami&rsquo;s school locker was a mystery box of letters, gifts, and adoration. She had so many confessions, it even got to the point where she stopped seeing any of them as genuine. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That led to her being called &ldquo;The Cold Princess&rdquo;. An urban legend spread stating that no boy could ever sway her hand. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami knew the rumors, and she hated them. It wasn&rsquo;t like she was against the idea of dating. She just didn&rsquo;t want someone who would only use her as an object for bragging. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sure, she carried herself like a haughty popular girl, but she was simply an innocent maiden deep down. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Unfortunately, in the eyes of many, including herself, it was unlikely she would ever find the one. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">That is, until the Little Prince arrived. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He seemed innocuous at first, almost ridiculous even. His blue and white costume seemed bright and jarring compared to all of the sickening pink and red Nanami had to endure at school several hours earlier. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But there was something about his aura that stood out to her. In the midst of all of the usual hubbub of school and popularity, this seemed rather fresh. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It wasn&rsquo;t like he called out to her either. She was just walking home after a busy day and was drawn to him, as he sat alone in a patch of grass. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um, hello there.&rdquo; She greeted, rather cautiously but also kind of curiously.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good day to you, fair maiden. I see you&rsquo;ve been drawn to me, just as I hoped.&rdquo; The prince replied, turning to her with a smile. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami caught a glance at his eyes. Emerald green, a striking color, to say the least. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Drawn to you? I just happened to notice you, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; She said, still a bit apprehensive.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, yes, but the fact that you&rsquo;ve noticed me brings happiness to my heart, for I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you for a long time.&rdquo; The prince replied, a kind smile on his face. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You act as if you know me.&rdquo; Nanami said, narrowing her eyes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s because I do, my lady. I know a lot of things. But though I do know you, I regret to say that I know very little about you personally. Why don&rsquo;t you take a seat, and we talk?&rdquo; Suggested the prince. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami hesitated, but not feeling immediate danger, she decided to sit down next to him. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright. Let&rsquo;s talk then. First things first, are you a real prince?&rdquo; She asked carefully.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The little prince chuckled. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In a manner of speaking. I would actually say that I&rsquo;m a humble boy in search of a fair lady.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami eyed him curiously. She was interested in learning more about him. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A fair lady? Aren&rsquo;t all boys that way?&rdquo; She asked, recalling bad memories.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alas, it is true. I&rsquo;ve seen the worst of it. But I&rsquo;ve traveled across distant lands and battled many a beast to see this lady of mine.&rdquo; Said the prince proudly. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">His words couldn&rsquo;t possibly be true. Nanami knew that for certain. And yet&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you often travel to far off places? Do you have many grand adventures, Mr Prince?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The prince nodded, grinning. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. That is the way of the prince. But my most recent journey has brought me here, to this wondrous place, for a very special reason.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tell me more!&rdquo; Nanami said eagerly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s quite simple. You see, I&rsquo;ve come seeking the aforementioned lady of ten years old, named Nanami. She&rsquo;s a delightful person, that I know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami blushed, looking away from the prince to hide the red on her face.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;M-me? B-but I&rsquo;m just a normal girl. What do I have to offer a prince?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find out, shall we? What is your favorite dessert?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um, lemon cake.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A good choice. What&rsquo;s your favorite type of flower?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Flowers&hellip;probably violets. I love violet roses.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sounds lovely. What is your favorite subject?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Math.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you have any siblings?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an only child.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay, lastly&hellip;what is your favorite pastime?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;promise you won&rsquo;t tell anyone?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;ll keep all of your secrets, my lady.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mm&hellip;fine! I really like going to arcades!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The little prince smiled. He seemed to glow in a sort of way that nearly blinded Nanami, but also seemed to draw her in. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, judging from all that you&rsquo;ve told me, there are plenty of great things you have to offer, and I accept all of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami couldn&rsquo;t quite put her finger on it, but his positivity was doing something to her. He was really genuine about all of this, and she felt sort of conflicted.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very kind, Mr Prince.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The little prince&rsquo;s laughter twinkled like wind chimes on the calm breeze, sending unknown sensations through her brain. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m honored to receive your praise. Now I must give you something as well.&rdquo; He said, pulling out an envelope and box of chocolates.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I hope you receive these as a sign of my travels for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami took the gifts, but hesitated to accept them as her own. She was accustomed to receiving Valentine&rsquo;s Day affection, but why did this feel different?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t accept this, Mr Prince. We literally just met. I don&rsquo;t know a whole lot about you.&rdquo; She said, sighing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The little prince nodded in apparent understanding, standing rather suddenly. He held out his hand with a smile. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see. In that case, why don&rsquo;t we accompany each other for the rest of this beautiful day? Maybe you&rsquo;ll come to know more about me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami couldn&rsquo;t quite remember what happened next. All she knew was she took the prince&rsquo;s hand, and after that, time passed in a blur. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She recalled bits and pieces, like how they visited an arcade and won lots of tickets, or how they tried crepes at a new dessert shop, but the day was so fun, she didn&rsquo;t really care what exactly they did. She just liked that they were together the whole time. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There were certain quirks to the prince, like how he already knew about some techniques in arcade games, or how he referenced school things Nanami never told him about, but she looked past all of that. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">However, the day had to come to an end eventually. As the sun set in the distance, Nanami realized with a pang of sadness that they would have to separate. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting dark.&rdquo; She muttered in disappointment.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, it appears so. I&rsquo;m afraid our time has drawn to a close.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami frowned, trying not to show the sadness in her eyes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Will I see you again?&rdquo; She asked, her voice barely above a whisper.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The little prince smiled, placing his hand in hers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fear not, fair maiden, for our paths shall cross in the future. On this same day next year, we shall meet once more. By that time, I trust you will have thought of me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He intertwined their fingers, which caused Nanami to blush again. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Cherish this day. For when we meet next, I will ask you if you remember it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami hesitated to let go of his hand, but she knew there was no point in doing so. Reluctantly, she parted ways with him, looking at his receding form with a sense of longing. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The same day&hellip;next year&hellip;you better remember, Mr Prince.&rdquo; She muttered. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And so the days passed as Nanami continued to think of the prince who moved her. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He had been the one to change things, and yet he disappeared as quickly as he appeared. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami often wondered: who was he? Where did he actually come from?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Most importantly, would they actually see each other again?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Only a year&rsquo;s worth of time would tell.</span></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.cd25uvfp9t5z"><span class="c1"></span></h3><h3 class="c4" id="h.lmnjozwj6cza"><span class="c1"></span></h3><h3 class="c4" id="h.f8mw2k7knnec"><span class="c1"></span></h3><h3 class="c4" id="h.my0thaph0ten"><span class="c1"></span></h3><h3 class="c4" id="h.eode8gq17fo"><span class="c1"></span></h3><h3 class="c4" id="h.e6vqc08hewfq"><span class="c1"></span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c6" id="h.v5ggzuv7ahn4"><span class="c10">February 14th, 2*** One Year Later</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Naturally, one year isn&rsquo;t enough to change a person&rsquo;s public perception. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami was still queen of her elementary school and had a highly desirable aura. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She still excelled in her classes and had athletic superiority.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But lately she seemed&hellip;preoccupied. A lot more stringent than usual. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The most recent confessions ended a lot more aggressively compared to the past. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What happened over the course of a year? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Well, we already know. Now that Nanami had met her prince, she was even less impressed with the kids in her classes. None of them could compare. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Is that an unfair comparison? Maybe.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Her friends, Reiko and Aoi, were always quick to tell her as such. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nanami, you can&rsquo;t keep hesitating like this!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, you got to cave in eventually.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami chuckled.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good, thanks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami opened her locker, and tons of valentines poured out. She winced and groaned.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I hate this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why? You should be thankful for all this attention.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t need it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It was true. She never felt the need for such things anymore. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What was the point of dating someone who didn&rsquo;t actually do anything for her? Was she supposed to fall for every person who sent her a Valentine&rsquo;s Day card?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So much wasted paper for such a wasted day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami muttered, to the both amusement and annoyance of her friends. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Reiko and Aoi couldn&rsquo;t quite understand her. Sure, they loved her to death, and would do anything for her in a heartbeat, but she also had some quirks they couldn&rsquo;t wrap their heads around. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Despite there being a few boys worth giving interest to, Nanami seemed to always turn everyone down. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Often her words were accompanied by whispers of being incomparable and princes. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami seemed to love talking about princes. But why? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">One time they decided to ask her about it&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nanami, what&rsquo;s all this talk about a prince?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A prince? Oh, you must mean the little prince. We promised to meet again&hellip;he was so great&hellip;no one can compare to his kindness&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Naturally, her answer made no sense to them, but to Nanami, it seemed the most obvious thing in the world. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Will I see you again, Mr Prince?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami sighed and glanced out the window, taking little heed to the monotonous words of the current lesson she was in.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The light of the sun seemed to glow around her, giving her form an ethereal effect. Nearby students couldn&rsquo;t help but stare at her, entranced. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Naturally, she noticed each pair of locked eyes, and felt extremely tempted to punch every single one. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Fortunately, Nanami couldn&rsquo;t be bothered. Her thoughts were elsewhere. The colors blue and white seemed to flutter through her mind all the time now. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">You promised&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">And her heart remained eternally wrapped by a promise. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She wanted him back. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The prince who twisted her so.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Today, some hour, some second, he would appear. But that didn&rsquo;t feel soon enough. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In an ironic twist of fate, the end of class arrived just as she reached the conclusion of her thoughts.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah&hellip;it&rsquo;s over&hellip;&rdquo; Nanami groaned.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She tiredly gathered her things and lept for the door eagerly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">What a solitary existence. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">To have so many admirers following her with their eyes, and yet only two friends.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami frowned and sighed as she walked through the busy hallways. At that moment, something in a secluded classroom caught her eye. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">A group of students were standing around a shaking boy, yelling at him with grins on their faces.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You loser! You&rsquo;ll never be cool like us! As long as we stand over you, you&rsquo;ll do what we say!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip;I want to get to class&hellip;&rdquo; The scared boy muttered. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut it, skimpy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ahahaha! That&rsquo;s a good one!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They laughed at his fear. Nanami witnessed all of this and could stand to watch it any longer.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, what are you doing to that boy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She cried, startling them as she stormed in.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fujiwara-san! We were just giving him what he deserves! You don&rsquo;t have to worry about this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami slapped the bully angrily.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that. Get away from him. Now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She snapped.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>The bullies scrambled out the room, leaving only her and the shaking boy. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;They must have really roughed you up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She muttered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami looked down and really took in the boy&rsquo;s appearance for the first time since entering the room. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She knew him. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He was Takahashi Sora, a classmate who sat a few seats in front of her in class. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Other students seemed to always be whispering about him, and Nanami often felt bad for the boy. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sure, he looked somewhat frail, and his black hair often covered his eyes, but he didn&rsquo;t deserve the horrible words he received. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, are you&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But before she could say anything to him, he ran off. Nanami could only look at his receding form worriedly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;s alright&hellip;&rdquo; She whispered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nanami.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s already lunch, and nothing has changed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Once again, Nanami received a critical rant from her friends, Reiko and Aoi, about dating.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re really doing this again?&rdquo; She asked in annoyance.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is for your own good, Nana.&rdquo; Reiko snapped.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, and we don&rsquo;t want to hear about princes this time.&rdquo; Aoi added.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami sighed in frustration.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But I really saw him. We promised.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Promises can be broken!&rdquo; Reiko shouted.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so passionate about all this.&rdquo; Nanami frowned.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. It&rsquo;s not like that prince of yours will just appear&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The sound of footsteps abruptly paused their conversation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My fair ladies.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami&rsquo;s eyes went wide in recognition. She stood up suddenly, tears threatening to fall.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nana? Is that&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It was. The blue and white dressy uniform. The blonde hair. The smile.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My fair Nanami. I do apologize for interrupting your private time, but I wished to see you after so long away.&rdquo; Said the undoubtable voice of the little prince. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami stuttered hard.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;M-m-Mr Prince?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, I am here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The little prince got down on one knee and kissed Nanami on her hand. Her face turned a bright shade of red, and her friends followed suit.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I wanted to give you some gifts on this great day, Nanami. I hope you accept them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The little prince pulls out a bouquet of beautiful violet roses and a purple envelope. He hands both of them to her, and she shakily accepts them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;you remembered&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. I will never forget anything you&rsquo;ve told me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">For the first time in her life, Nanami felt publicly embarrassed. She wanted to hide herself, for she knew she was blushing extremely hard. At the same time, she really wanted to tell the prince how she felt about him, but&hellip;she just couldn&rsquo;t get over her nervousness.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;T-thank you for these, Mr. Prince. But how did you know I was here? Are you a student at this school? What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; She asked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Student? I&rsquo;m a prince, my lady.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re&hellip;you have to be someone here at school&hellip;who are you? I&rsquo;d really like to know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The little prince looked to the ground.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo; He nervously whispered, going somewhat out of character.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Suddenly, he ran away before Nanami could say anything else to him. She felt guilty for pressing him on such a subject but she just really wanted to know&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nanami, you have great taste.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m impressed, Nana.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami eyed her friends in disappointment.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So now you&rsquo;re fine with it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Back to classes, Nanami found herself surprisingly paired up with the black haired boy from earlier, Sora. They were assigned math work together.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;H-hello&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He shyly greeted her. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hi, Takahashi-kun. Let&rsquo;s get this done with, shall we? I&rsquo;m good at math, so this&rsquo;ll go quickly!&rdquo; Nanami said confidently.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to tell me&hellip;&rdquo; Sora muttered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">They found themselves getting through their work fairly easily.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami was honestly surprised by how well they got along. Sora was a little shy, but he spoke up often enough to where conversations continued naturally. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In the end, she felt that there was something familiar about him. His presence gave her a comfort which she could recall&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fujiwara-san?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sora looked up from the paper he had been writing on, feeling her stares. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Amongst his black hair, Nanami noticed a color. Green. Like emeralds. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Why did that seem important to her? Did she see that color before? There was something she knew, but she couldn&rsquo;t remember&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. I was just thinking about something&hellip;&rdquo; She said, assuring. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sora eyed her curiously and then returned to looking at his paper. Then he muttered:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thanks for earlier&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami&rsquo;s eyes went wide, and then she smiled.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami left school feeling tired. Not that that was a rare occurrence.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But today it seemed particularly worse than usual.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey Nana, look there!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Reiko whispered, pointing near the school gate. Nanami followed her gaze and a large smile grew on her face.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mr Prince!&rdquo; She cried, to the surprise of those near her (including her friends). They had never heard her use such an emotional voice.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami ran over to the gate, where a figure in a blue and white attire stood. Her prince had come once again.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My lady, you look tired. Allow me to soothe your wounds.&rdquo; The little prince said, holding out his hand.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami took him on his offer almost immediately.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; She exclaimed. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Her surprised classmates watched as the notorious &ldquo;cold princess&rdquo; willingly walked off with a boy, hand in hand. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What shall we do today, Mr Prince?&rdquo; Nanami asked eagerly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Anything you desire.&rdquo; The little prince responded.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The following hours were better than Nanami could have ever imagined. They went to a restaurant, shared desserts, and ended with an arcade. Memories of the day one year ago resurfaced.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This day has been so fun&hellip;&rdquo; Nanami muttered as she played an arcade game.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I agree. Your company always brings me joy, my lady.&rdquo; The little prince agreed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami laughed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If only the boys in my class were half as nice as you are.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As if on cue, loud voices began to reach their ears.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oi, Fujiwara-san!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">It was the group of bullies from earlier.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stand back, my lady.&rdquo; Said the little prince, putting distance between them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Out of the way, idiot. We aren&rsquo;t here for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">One of the bullies sneered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you harm this lady.&rdquo; The little prince said firmly, though he was beginning to shake.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t hurt her. We just want to talk&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As if! I have no business with you bullies!&rdquo; Nanami yelled.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">One of the bullies cried, throwing powerful punches towards her. Unfortunately, the little prince took every punch himself, getting bruised and injured. Nanami couldn&rsquo;t stand to watch it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How dare you?!&rdquo; She screamed, charging at the bullies wildly in anger. She punched and kicked them without caring who she hit, and as the dust settled, they were all knocked clean out.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ow&hellip;&rdquo; The little prince groaned.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami ran over to him worriedly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mr Prince!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you are safe&hellip;my lady&hellip;&rdquo; He smiled, before fainting.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami caught a glance of his eyes just as this happened, and a sudden connection clicked in her mind.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Green. Like emeralds. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">How did it take this long for her to realize the significance?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She knew who this prince was.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The little prince woke in the middle of a park. He found himself lying in Nanami&rsquo;s lap (she was blushing). </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re alright!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami exclaimed, breathing a sigh of relief. She held him close.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At that moment, the little prince realized something. A wig lying nearby. It couldn&rsquo;t be&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you see&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami nodded.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;you&rsquo;re Takahashi-kun, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; She asked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The prince, now identified as Sora, sighed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t supposed to find out&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why would you hide this from me? Couldn&rsquo;t you have just told me all this time?&rdquo; Nanami asked, slightly upset.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3" id="h.8qhcs3cx2rk3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I often feel&hellip;scared. Like I&rsquo;m the only one in this world who&rsquo;s weird, while everyone else is normal. I get terrified that my actions are always going to be judged, even when it&rsquo;s something simple. I don&rsquo;t really like talking to people if I don&rsquo;t know them. I just&hellip;feel like a huge failure&hellip;like I could break at any second&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.fmacre2z3jve"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3" id="h.tuoglffpxeee"><span class="c0">Nanami hugged him and held him close.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.hyjce5zdbahj"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3" id="h.n1lmfyhuqy9f"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, the prince&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.uau2xlaok4ud"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3" id="h.eivq9ujpmrjq"><span class="c0">Sora looked to the ground.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.h2zgdk662pg6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3" id="h.v2roezrqvuqv"><span class="c0">&ldquo;For some reason, I feel more confident when I&rsquo;m dressed that way.

Don&rsquo;t be scared&hellip;&rdquo; Sora said softly, rubbing her back with soft movements. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami&rsquo;s breathing slowed and she ceased shaking as much. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Y-you&rsquo;re good at this&hellip;&rdquo; She murmured. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have siblings&hellip;&rdquo; Sora explained.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">For a few minutes they sat there in silence, finding solitude in each other&#39;s arms and the sound of rain. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Thunder and lightning didn&rsquo;t bother them anymore.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Overwhelmed by everything, Nanami couldn&rsquo;t hold back her words. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I like you.&rdquo; She whispered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sora&rsquo;s eyes went wide, as he heard the words he never thought he&rsquo;d hear.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">He couldn&rsquo;t fathom a way to respond, and so he said nothing. But deep down they knew their feelings were equal. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">An hour passed, and the rain finally subsided. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As Sora made for the door, they stared at each other.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s time to leave.&rdquo; He muttered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Nanami agreed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Yet neither wanted to let each other go. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet again, right?&rdquo; Nanami asked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sora had a blip of recognition and then smiled. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow.&rdquo; He said, getting on one knee and kissing her hand.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami blushed, but said nothing as Sora left her home. She felt all kinds of warm ways and didn&rsquo;t know what to do. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I like you so much, Sora&hellip;&rdquo; She muttered, intoxicated by her own love.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><hr><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At school the next day, Nanami was greeted by glaring eyes.

Everyone noticed this, and even they couldn&rsquo;t help but see a positive change. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Her coldness seemed to have been shed, and her demeanor carried the happiness of a regular girl. Nanami had been born anew.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You look happy.&rdquo; Reiko said with a grin.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am.&rdquo; Nanami responded, smiling. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Even her friends were surprised by this new Nanami. She was just so different.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">But that was nothing compared to what happened later. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This new Nanami walked into her morning class without stopping at her normal seat. People&rsquo;s eyes curiously followed her, and went wide when they saw who she stopped at.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;G-good morning&hellip;&rdquo; Sora muttered.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nanami gave a bright, blinding smile.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good morning, Mr Prince!&rdquo; She exclaimed, before leaning down and doing the unthinkable to everyone.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">She kissed Sora square on the lips. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
