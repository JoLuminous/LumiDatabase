A girl that changed her life in many ways. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko had always loved the company of friends. She was extremely sociable and admittedly lacked a good sense of judgment when it came to approaching people. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But lately, she&rsquo;s found herself in unknown territory. In her many years of life, Nadeshiko had never experienced the feeling of having her thoughts dominated. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed that no matter what she did, the visage of one Rin Shima would always intrude. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko cared deeply for her blue-haired friend. She had introduced her to the world of camping, and on many occasions, had proven the depth of her kindness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was no wonder that her platonic feelings had become something else entirely. Rin&#39;s calm demeanor, her love for solitude, and her quiet strength had captured Nadeshiko&#39;s heart. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">But how could she tell </span><span class="c9">Rin</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;about her feelings without risking their precious friendship? Would Rin even feel the same way if she told her?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko sighed deeply, just as her friends Chiaki Oogaki and Aoi Inuyama walked in from their classes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nadeshiko, are you here daydreaming again? It&rsquo;s almost like something is bothering you&hellip;&rdquo; Chiaki teased, a sly grin on her face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing. I&rsquo;m just a little tired.&rdquo; Nadeshiko lied. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Really? Or is it something&mdash;or someone&mdash;else?&rdquo; Aoi asked, her eyes twinkling with amusement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko&#39;s cheeks flushed a deep pink. &ldquo;Wh-what are you talking about?&rdquo; she stammered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chiaki leaned closer, her grin widening. &ldquo;Come on, Nadeshiko, you can&#39;t fool us. We&#39;ve known for months. You&#39;re head over heels for Rin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko&#39;s eyes widened in surprise. &ldquo;You... you knew?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aoi nodded, her smile gentle. &ldquo;It&#39;s pretty obvious. The way you light up when you talk about her, how you always want to go camping if she&#39;s going...It&#39;s sweet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko buried her face in her hands. &ldquo;Oh no, I&#39;m so embarrassed!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chiaki groaned and patted her on the back. &ldquo;Did you think we couldn&rsquo;t tell? You&rsquo;re so clearly in love with her, it&rsquo;s pretty unbearable. Go ahead and confess already!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I...I don&#39;t know,&rdquo; Nadeshiko admitted, peeking out from between her fingers. &ldquo;I&#39;m scared. What if she doesn&#39;t feel the same way?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&#39;ll never know unless you try,&rdquo; Aoi said kindly. &ldquo;But make sure you do it in a way that feels natural.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko nodded slowly. &ldquo;You&#39;re right. I just&hellip;need to find the right moment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Later that day, Nadeshiko returned home, her mind still buzzing with never-ending thoughts of Rin. Her older sister, Sakura Kagamihara, was sitting at the kitchen table, sipping tea and reading a book.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Welcome back, Nadeshiko,&rdquo; Sakura greeted her without looking up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hi, Sakura-nee,&rdquo; Nadeshiko replied, dropping her bag by the door and joining her sister at the table.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakura finally looked up, her sharp eyes scrutinizing her younger sister. &ldquo;You seem troubled. Something on your mind?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko fidgeted, unsure of whether to tell her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I am not thinking about anything!&rdquo; She said a little too quickly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakura stared at her with a disbelieving look. She couldn&rsquo;t help but shake under the gaze. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&hellip;Is that so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko flinched at her words. Her older sister always had a way of seeing right through her, and it was both comforting and intimidating. Feeling she couldn&rsquo;t get out of this, she hesitantly decided to spill the truth. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, there&#39;s this&hellip;person I like,&rdquo; she began slowly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakura raised an eyebrow knowingly. &ldquo;And this person wouldn&#39;t happen to be Rin, would it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko&#39;s mouth fell open. &ldquo;How does everyone know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakura smiled slightly. &ldquo;You&#39;re not exactly subtle, Nadeshiko. So, what do you plan on doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko sighed. &ldquo;I want to tell her, but I don&#39;t know how. I thought maybe...a camping trip? Somewhere special, where I can find the right moment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakura nodded thoughtfully. &ldquo;That sounds like a good idea. Do you have a place in mind?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Nadeshiko admitted. &ldquo;Do you think you could help me pick something?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sakura&#39;s smile widened. &ldquo;Of course. Let&#39;s look at some options.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Together, they poured over maps and guides, eventually settling on a charming campsite in an area known for its beautiful views and cozy atmosphere. It was the perfect place for a heartfelt confession.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next day at school, Nadeshiko nervously approached Rin in the library. She had rehearsed what she was going to say a hundred times, but now that the moment was here, she almost wished she could be somewhere else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rin-chan, do you have any plans this weekend?&rdquo; Nadeshiko finally asked, trying to sound casual.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin looked up from a book she was reading, her expression curious. &ldquo;Not really. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko took a deep breath. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I was thinking of going camping and...I was wondering if you&#39;d like to come with me. I found this really nice spot, and I thought it would be fun to go together.&rdquo; She said, handing her a small plan she had written out the night before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin glanced at the plan and raised an eyebrow, a small smile tugging at her lips. &ldquo;You planned all this just for a simple camping trip?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko nodded vigorously. &ldquo;Yes! I mean, no! I mean, I just thought it would be nice, you know, to spend some time together!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin&rsquo;s smile grew, and she nodded. &ldquo;Alright, Nadeshiko. I&#39;d love to go camping with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko&#39;s heart soared. &ldquo;Really? Oh, thank you, Rin-chan! It&#39;s going to be so much fun!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin chuckled softly. &quot;I&#39;m sure.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The rest of the week flew by in a blur of preparation, excitement, and tense nerves. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko could hardly contain her anticipation as she packed her camping gear, carefully selecting everything she would need to make the confession go well. Sakura watched her sister with a mix of amusement and affection, offering occasional advice when needed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, the day arrived. Nadeshiko and Rin met at the bus stop early in the morning, their luggage packed neatly and spirits high. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you when I&rsquo;m close to the campsite.&rdquo; Rin said, making sure her motorcycle was secured. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko nodded. &ldquo;Alright. See you around&hellip;1:30?&rdquo; She suggested. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sounds good.&rdquo; Rin said with a smile, fastening her helmet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko smiled back at her and boarded the bus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She felt a flutter in her nerves as she found a nice seat. This was it&mdash;the beginning of the trip that would reveal her feelings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she finally arrived at the next bus stop, Nadeshiko set off towards the campsite, the city a charming mix of quaint streets and wonderful views. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She felt a small surge of confidence. Things were going well, and hopefully, her good luck would continue. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, she received a call from Rin, who had already arrived at the campsite. Nadeshiko took the long trek to meet back up with her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There you are, Rin-chan!&rdquo; She exclaimed upon seeing the blue-haired girl.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Looks like you got here just fine.&rdquo; Rin said with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As they found their plot and began to set up their tents, Nadeshiko couldn&#39;t help but steal glances at Rin, her heart rapidly beating. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rin-chan,&rdquo; she said softly as they finished setting up, &ldquo;Thank you for coming with me. This means a lot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin looked at her, her eyes warm and understanding. &ldquo;Of course, Nadeshiko. I&#39;m glad you decided to invite me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko smiled, feeling a surge of courage. This trip was her golden chance, and she definitely couldn&rsquo;t let it go to waste.</span></p><p class="c10 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5 c16"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c16 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c16 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c16 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c16 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c16 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.nv58heookf5e"><span class="c17">Chapter II - Apply the Bribe</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The cool spring air created the perfect conditions for camping and exploration. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko scrolled through a long list of activities on her phone, debating on what to choose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Where should we go first, Rin-chan?&rdquo; Nadeshiko asked, her eyes sparkling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin glanced around, taking in the charming aura of the streets. &ldquo;How about that caf&eacute; over there? I could use a drink after that long drive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko nodded enthusiastically. &ldquo;Great idea!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They made their way to the caf&eacute;, a small, inviting place with an old-timey exterior. Inside, they found a table by the window and ordered hot chocolates.

I like these places that make you feel secluded and cozy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko chuckled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Solitude is always going to be your preference, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin smiled shamelessly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo; She shrugged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They sat in content silence for a while, simply taking in the atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Say, Nadeshiko&hellip;&rdquo; Rin started, breaking the silence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko looked up from her cup. &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was thinking&hellip;maybe on our next group trip, we can invite Ayano and make it a grand meet-up.&rdquo; Rin suggested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko&rsquo;s eyes lit up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I would love that!&rdquo; She exclaimed eagerly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin chuckled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I figured you would.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They chatted for a bit about various things, the conversation flowing easily between them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko felt her nervousness melt away in the warmth of Rin&rsquo;s company. After finishing their drinks, they decided to explore the local shops.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As they wandered through the streets, Nadeshiko made sure to point out interesting things. They visited a small bookstore, where Nadeshiko picked up a camping guidebook with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Look, Rin-chan! Maybe we can find some new places to explore next time!&rdquo; Nadeshiko said, her enthusiasm infectious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin nodded, her eyes twinkling. &ldquo;Definitely. I&rsquo;m always up for discovering new spots.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They continued their stroll, stopping by a local convenience store. The shelves were brimming with fresh produce and an assortment of local delicacies. Nadeshiko&rsquo;s eyes lit up as she spotted some high-quality ingredients. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rin-chan, look at these! They have some amazing ingredients here. I should get some for dinner tonight,&rdquo; she said, already reaching for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin raised an eyebrow, curious. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the occasion?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko blushed slightly, but kept her tone light. &ldquo;Oh, n-nothing special. I just thought it would be nice to make a really good meal tonight since we&rsquo;re on this trip together.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin nodded, though she couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling that there was more to Nadeshiko&rsquo;s intentions. That slight stutter did not go unnoticed by her. &ldquo;Sounds good to me. Let&rsquo;s see what they have.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko spent the next hour selecting ingredients, picking out the finest cuts of meat, fresh vegetables, and aromatic herbs. Rin watched her friend with a mixture of amusement and curiosity, wondering what she had planned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When she tried to ask about it, Nadeshiko would only cryptically respond: &ldquo;All in due time, Rin-chan!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As they continued their exploration, Nadeshiko&rsquo;s phone buzzed with incoming messages. She glanced at it briefly, recognizing the names of her friends from the Outdoor Activities Club, Chiaki and Aoi. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Aoi: &ldquo;Hey, how&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chiaki: &ldquo;So, have you kissed her yet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko blushed and quickly hid her phone in her pocket, deciding to focus purely on making the day as perfect as possible. She hadn&rsquo;t even considered kissing her just yet&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, Rin-chan, there&rsquo;s a bridge nearby that&rsquo;s supposed to have a beautiful view. Want to check it out?&rdquo; Nadeshiko suggested, introducing a subject as a distraction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sure, lead the way,&rdquo; Rin replied, following Nadeshiko with a smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The bridge overlooked the bustling city, producing a picturesque view that was breathtaking to them both. They found a bench with a nice angle and sat down, enjoying the peaceful afternoon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m admittedly a little tired of bridges right now,&rdquo; Rin remarked, her gaze sweeping over the scenery. &ldquo;But this is pretty nice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko nodded. &ldquo;It is. I&rsquo;m so glad we decided to come here. It&rsquo;s been such a fun day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin turned to her, a soft smile on her lips. &ldquo;Yeah, it has. I always enjoy spending time with you, Nadeshiko.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat at Rin&rsquo;s words. She hoped the warmth in her cheeks wasn&rsquo;t too obvious. &ldquo;Me too, Rin-chan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They sat in companionable silence for a while, soaking in the beauty of their surroundings. As the afternoon drifted slowly into evening, they begrudgingly headed back to their campsite.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the fall of night, Nadeshiko began the important task of preparing dinner. She carefully arranged, measured, and cut the ingredients she had bought, her hands moving with practiced ease. At the same time, she also carefully navigated her phone, making sure a recipe (which she prepared beforehand) was being followed properly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin watched her, intrigued by the level of care and effort Nadeshiko was putting into the meal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really going all out.&rdquo; Rin noted, stepping closer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko shook her head, smiling. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I always? I just want this to be perfect!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin chuckled, settling down by the fire and watching as Nadeshiko did what she does best. The aroma of tender meat and toasted vegetables soon filled the air, making Rin&rsquo;s stomach rumble in anticipation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Nadeshiko cooked, her phone buzzed again. She glanced at the screen, seeing another message from Chiaki: &ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t leave us in suspense! How&rsquo;d her lips feel?&rdquo; Nadeshiko embarrassedly put her phone away fast, silencing it for good, and returned to the task at hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, the meal was ready. Nadeshiko set the table with care, eyeing Rin as she placed every piece of the scrumptious puzzle before her. Rin&rsquo;s eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wow, Nadeshiko, you&rsquo;ve really gone above and beyond tonight,&rdquo; she said, genuinely impressed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko beamed, feeling a surge of pride. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think so! I wanted to make something really special for us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They sat down to eat, the fire casting a warm glow and soothing the night chill. Rin took her first bite, her eyes widening further as she savored the flavors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is&hellip;incredible!&rdquo; Rin exclaimed, looking at the food with admiration. She scarfed down several bites of it, only stopping occasionally to catch her breath. &ldquo;How on earth are you so good at this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko&rsquo;s heart soared at Rin&rsquo;s praise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy you like it, Rin-chan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They ate in comfortable silence, the night ambience providing serenity. Nadeshiko watched Rin carefully, her heart pounding with every passing moment. She knew that the time for her confession was drawing near. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But how does one broach the subject?</span></p><p class="c8 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.4cg4x5q11j4e"><span class="c17">Chapter III - Broach the Subject</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The crackling of the campfire filled the air as Nadeshiko and Rin sat in silence, both lost in their own thoughts. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin flipped through the pages of a book she had brought, famished from that night&rsquo;s dinner. Nadeshiko watched her intently, her mind a complete mess. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Like a game of Mortal Kombat, two halves of her mind fought for dominance. One side of her was saying she should go ahead and confess, while the other was telling her to keep her mouth shut, lest things become awkward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What was she supposed to do? The moment was right, but what if she got a bad response? Would their friendship be jeopardized?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then suddenly, Rin placed her book aside and turned towards her with a smirk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So&hellip;go ahead and start talking.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko nearly jumped in surprise. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-huh? What are you talking about?&rdquo; She stammered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin crossed her arms and stared. &ldquo;You brought me on this trip for a reason, didn&rsquo;t you, Nadeshiko?&rdquo; She asked, a knowing look in her eyes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko squirmed in place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; She took a slow, deep breath, gathering the mess that was her thoughts. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. I invited you here because&hellip;I wanted to tell you something.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0" id="h.8gcu13p8xh4x"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It must be pretty important then.&rdquo; Rin nodded.</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.j49veezbfldy"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You could say that.&rdquo; Nadeshiko muttered with a blush, glancing nervously at the campfire. She could feel her heart pounding in her chest as she struggled to admit what she wanted to say. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She took another deep breath, steeling herself for what was to come. This was it&mdash;the moment she had spent so much time planning for and anticipating, the moment she would finally lay her feelings bare.</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.xifexf6aib31"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this for a while now,&rdquo; Nadeshiko began, her voice shaky and nervous. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know how to bring it up, but I knew I had to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.cwoheshxhvgp"><span class="c1">Rin&rsquo;s expression softened, her inquisitive facade melting away. She leaned forward slightly, offering Nadeshiko her undivided attention. </span></p><p class="c0" id="h.npv8rblzzexs"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Nadeshiko. Just take your time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.ujz3rc2nr2e9"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko nodded, grateful for Rin&rsquo;s understanding. She took another deep breath, trying to steady her nerves.</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.16gw0hbdu5j7"><span class="c1">&ldquo;When I think about it, the way I feel is similar to how you feel about camping. It makes you feel content and peaceful, right? And, well, it&rsquo;s the same for me, but&hellip;regarding you. Every time we go on these trips together, I feel&hellip;complete. Like everything just makes sense.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.7ln5lrj73ub7"><span class="c1">Rin&rsquo;s eyes widened slightly in surprise, but she remained quiet, allowing Nadeshiko to continue.</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.7kup8mummepa"><span class="c1">&ldquo;At first, I thought it was just the excitement of being outdoors,&rdquo; Nadeshiko went on, her voice growing steadier. &ldquo;But then I realized it wasn&rsquo;t just that. It was you. Being with you makes me happier than I&rsquo;ve ever been. And it&rsquo;s not just about the time we share, but about you as a person. Your kindness, your maturity, the way you always offer me helpful advice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.3o9a00urpik3"><span class="c1">Rin stared intently, taking in her words. Nadeshiko blushed under her gaze, but waited with bated breath for her inevitable response. </span></p><p class="c0" id="h.ejpgphex0lsq"><span class="c1">Her voice was gentle when she finally spoke, and her face was slightly red. &ldquo;Nadeshiko, I&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t know you felt that way. I mean, I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed our time together too, but I never thought&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.gqv4b3a2c54y"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko interrupted, a cacophony of words tumbling out of her mouth carelessly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if this is too sudden or if it makes things awkward. I just couldn&rsquo;t keep it to myself any longer. I&rsquo;ve fallen for you, Rin-chan. I love you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.msqvf0xay6qa"><span class="c1">For a moment, there was silence. Rin&rsquo;s eyes searched Nadeshiko&rsquo;s face, her own emotions a mix of surprise, confusion, and something else Nadeshiko couldn&rsquo;t quite identify.</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.fvz0818p5i34"><span class="c1">Then, slowly, a small smile spread across Rin&rsquo;s face. It wasn&rsquo;t her usual reserved expression, but a genuine, kind smile that lit up her features. </span></p><p class="c0" id="h.oc333ebuu4ra"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nadeshiko, I&hellip;I&rsquo;m really glad you told me. To be honest, I&rsquo;ve always felt something more between us too. I just didn&rsquo;t know how to admit it.&rdquo; She muttered shyly.</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.eyaydhwvaq4h"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko&rsquo;s heart soared at Rin&rsquo;s response. &ldquo;Really? You mean it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.p265q6b5nayv"><span class="c1">Rin nodded, her smile growing wider. </span></p><p class="c0" id="h.b3f0r6o93w63"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, really. I guess I was just waiting for the right moment to tell you. And, well&hellip;this seems like the perfect time, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.ikgn0lejf8zs"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko laughed, a sound filled with relief and joy. She reached out and grabbed Rin in a hug, squeezing her gently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy, Rin-chan! I&rsquo;ve wanted to hear those words for so long!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.lpjq31lc0yt2"><span class="c1">Rin squeezed her back, her face full of meek embarrassment. &ldquo;&hellip;Me too, Nadeshiko.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.6ikjfmbx83wq"><span class="c1">They sat in comfortable silence for a while, simply enjoying each other&rsquo;s presence. Nadeshiko felt a sense of contentment she had never experienced before.</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.qh8gb420k5h2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Say&hellip;do you remember our first time camping together?&rdquo; Rin asked suddenly, breaking the silence. </span></p><p class="c0" id="h.lgzgy04v6iot"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko giggled, the memory bringing a nostalgic smile to her face. &ldquo;Of course, how could I forget? The view of Mount Fuji, the taste of store-bought ramen, and, most importantly, I met the most wonderful camper who changed my life.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0" id="h.tdj92tv182ro"><span class="c1">Rin blushed and chuckled a bit. &ldquo;Yeah, and I met an unusual, cheerful girl who was quite amusing&hellip;at the time, I didn&rsquo;t think I would get used to her crazy antics, but as I got to know her better&hellip;I realized that she had become an important person to me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.2eqt8d6cmf1r"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko felt tears of happiness welling up in her eyes. She blinked them away, but couldn&rsquo;t contain her emotion &ldquo;Rin-chan&hellip;I really love you. I really do. More than anything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin chuckled softly, wiping some of the tears from Nadeshiko&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Dummy, why are you the one crying? It should be the other way around.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko sniffled, wiping away more tears with a laugh. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it! I&rsquo;m just so relieved and happy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They sat there for a while, wrapped in each other&rsquo;s arms, basking in the relief of their feelings finally being free. At last they could breathe without fretting over one another in secret. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They sat there, shoulders touching, wondering and talking about miscellaneous things: fond memories, favorite travel foods, and most importantly, the future. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I envision us going to campsites when we&rsquo;re really old, like 80 or something! It&rsquo;ll be more difficult than now, but we&rsquo;ll be together for each other.&rdquo; Nadeshiko posited.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin shook her head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That sounds sweet, but&hellip;80 is a little too old for camping.&rdquo; She countered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It was just a suggestion.&rdquo; Nadeshiko shrugged. &ldquo;Maybe when we&rsquo;re 60! We can still go camping then!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin chuckled. &ldquo;Sure. If we&rsquo;re able to, I&rsquo;d love to keep going.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko giggled and threw an arm around her shoulder. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We might even have kids that we can bring, Rin-chan!&rdquo; She exclaimed, causing Rin to cough violently. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...Nadeshiko, how much have you thought about this?&rdquo; She asked, holding a hand over her face to hide her blush. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm&hellip;I&rsquo;ve just considered small things. Like how we&rsquo;ll live in a nice cozy townhouse with two kids, maybe they&rsquo;ll be adopted or we could go through other means. And at some point, we&rsquo;ll pass down our camping equipment to them, and watch them become seasoned campers like us. Just small things like that.&rdquo; Nadeshiko explained, in way too much words. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin stared, her mouth hanging open at an odd angle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve thought about pretty much everything!&rdquo; She exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko rubbed the back of her head sheepishly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;...yes, I have.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin shook her head and then laughed. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I really need to learn how to anticipate you, Nadeshiko. You always seem to catch me off guard in unfair ways.&rdquo; She said with a defeated sigh. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko grinned and turned to face her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Rin-chan, but when it comes to me, you&rsquo;ll never see me coming.&rdquo; She said, and before Rin could process the cryptic remark, Nadeshiko closed the distance between them, pressing her lips to Rin&rsquo;s in a sudden, unexpected kiss. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin sat in shock, eyes wide, even after the kiss was over; her mind struggled to catch up with what had just happened. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh at her stunned reaction. She stuck her tongue out mischievously, her eyes sparkling with delight. &ldquo;I got you again!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin slowly brought a hand to her face, attempting to hide the small smile that was forming. She let out a soft, resigned laugh, shaking her head in disbelief. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re unbelievable,&rdquo; she murmured, a meek amusement in her voice. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko grinned, feeling a surge of happiness. Everything had gone just the way she wanted, and best of all, her feelings were reciprocated. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There truly was nothing quite like the satisfaction of seeing a plan come to fruition.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.5u8y4lo5yu66"><span class="c17">Prelude - When She Realized</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The cool winter air swirled as Shima Rin pulled her motorcycle into a vacant parking space. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Removing her helmet, she shivered, her breath visible from the cold. She tightened her scarf gingerly and unpacked some tied belongings. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The wind rustled through the trees, and the scent of fresh soot filled the air. Rin sat by her campfire, the soothing crackle of the flames aiding her thoughts. Here in the forest, she was free to be herself without the prying eyes of others. This was her place, her moment of freedom and bliss. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet&hellip;something about this night felt different. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin gazed into the fire, her thoughts drifting. When did camping alone begin to feel so&hellip;empty? It wasn&rsquo;t like this before. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A pink-haired whirlwind of energy had turned her world upside down. From the moment they had met, Nadeshiko had brought a cacophony of absurd emotions that were completely unfamiliar to her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first, Rin brushed it off as part of their friendship, the bond they had developed over their many experiences camping. But recently, those feelings had taken on a form that distracted her at every turn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin sighed, running a hand through her hair. She had been trying to convince herself that she wasn&rsquo;t in love, that what she felt for Nadeshiko was just a strong sense of platonic friendship. But the more she tried to suppress her turbulent thoughts, the stronger they grew. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How does one get rid of such distractions?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin reached into her bag, her fingers brushing against something unfamiliar. Curious, she pulled out the object, revealing a small, mischievous book which gave her pause. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; it greeted, as if goading her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The cover depicted two girls holding hands, and the title read, &ldquo;Am I Into The Opposite Sex?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin stared at the book with a look that was both awe-struck and troubled. When had she purchased this book? Was it a moment of pure unconscious spontaneousness? Had someone slipped it into her bag as a prank? Was it a sign from the universe?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But despite her grumbling, she was curious. She couldn&rsquo;t help but slowly lift the book, handling it like it was some sort of cursed item. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never considered this before&hellip;why now of all times?&rdquo; She muttered, begrudgingly flipping through the pages. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The book was filled with stories, advice, and reflections on love between women. As she read, her resistance began to crumble like it never even existed in the first place. The words resonated with her, echoing the emotions she had been trying so hard to ignore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin knew why this was beginning to happen. She was picturing pink again. She definitely knew. It certainly didn&rsquo;t help that every word of the book lined up with what she experienced. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko was a disruptor in every sense of the word, making her consider these embarrassing things for the first time. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin sighed and stared at the campfire with a conflicted glower. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9 c22">Hm</span><span class="c9">, she thought, </span><span class="c9 c22">The fire looks pretty appealing right about now.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wanted badly to throw the mischievous book in, to burn away the uncertainty and doubt with the rest of its bothersome pages. She stood up, holding the book over the flames, her hands trembling. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The cursed thing wasn&rsquo;t even meant to be here in the first place, so what harm would a little fire do? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the thoughtful side of her brain said, placing a metaphorical hand on her own. &ldquo;You know the book isn&rsquo;t lying, don&rsquo;t you? You just don&rsquo;t want to admit the truth to yourself.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin frowned. What an idiot she was, arguing with herself over something so obvious. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She carefully placed the book next to her and sighed, staring up at the night stars... </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin thought back to past memories, unleashing a brief moment of reminiscence. She smiled, remembering the first time she camped with Nadeshiko, how their friendship blossomed and how she became friends with the Outdoors Club, even the time she became worried for Nadeshiko because of her first solo camp. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nadeshiko&rsquo;s face appeared in every memory, and Rin envisioned her enthusiasm at mundane things, her unrivaled skill at cooking, and her amusingly cheerful personality. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin chuckled, recalling how much Nadeshiko begged her to get involved with the Outdoors Club in the beginning. It wasn&rsquo;t like she had to be there, but Nadeshiko was so adamant&hellip;how could she have said no at that time? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You really didn&rsquo;t have to try so hard,&rdquo; Rin said with a smile, &ldquo;But I suppose your persistence is one of the many things I like about you.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At that moment, time seemed to freeze. Rin felt her face grow hot and looked to the ground, eyes wide. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She just said that out loud, didn&rsquo;t she? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, what the heck?&rdquo; Rin shook her head. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What was the use in lying anymore? The truth was clear to her from the beginning. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I love her.&rdquo; she whispered to the night, her voice soft as she gave a resigned smile. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Admitting it out loud made it feel more real, and even more undeniable. But with that acceptance, there was just one other dilemma Rin had yet to consider. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How would she even begin to explain these feelings to Nadeshiko? How could someone reserved like her ever confess such a personal truth to someone so overzealous?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Silently Rin opened the book again, searching for guidance within its pages. Various possibilities stood out, but all of them were way outside of her comfort zone. She just wasn&rsquo;t the kind of person to reveal intimate facets about herself. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What was the best way to do this naturally? Without embarrassment? Without shame? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin tossed the book aside and leaned back in her folding chair. She allowed her eyes to close, feeling the calm of the outdoors wash over her. In that moment of solidarity and pleasant comfort, a sudden idea came to mind. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A small smile grew on her face and she chuckled, feeling foolish. The answer to her puzzle was right in front of her the whole time. Why was she overthinking this so much? &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a perfect way for her to reveal her feelings. A method that was true to her very character. All she had to was go back to what everything started with. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rin had to go camping again.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
