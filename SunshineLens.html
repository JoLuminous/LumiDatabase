They were evil things that only sought to highlight her imperfections and loneliness. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A phenomenon that seemed to exist from her very birth, Hitori and photography never seemed to mix. Whenever she tried to smile, it just came off as creepy or disturbing. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It didn&rsquo;t help that photos were all over apps like Instagram, Twitter, and other social media. Hitori was naturally a poor fit for photos. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why, she wondered, would anyone want to take a picture with her, when the result would be equivalent to that of a cryptid sighting? </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Photos were for extroverts, those far off creatures. That was an entirely different dimension&mdash; no, universe, from Hitori.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that was what she used to think.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Somewhere along the line, an odd change seemed to occur within the shy girl, and somehow she ended up directly parallel to a dimension beyond her own. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The portal to this dimension was one you could not avoid, if you could call a young high school girl a &ldquo;portal&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes, the walking ball of sunshine, Kita Ikuyo, had become Hitori&rsquo;s friend, due to circumstances she still has trouble believing. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are many ways you could describe the sparkling girl named Kita, but Hitori, the natural songwriter, had a few words in mind that she would never tell anyone. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I&#39;ll tell you in her place. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori Gotoh thought Kita was a wonderful girl that expressed an overwhelming amount of sympathy and kindness. She always helps everyone when it&rsquo;s necessary, and doesn&rsquo;t judge a person by any parameters. She was inclusive, understanding. When Hitori felt uncomfortable with a certain task or action, Kita wouldn&rsquo;t force it. When Hitori needed comfort in a sad situation, Kita was always there to make her feel happy again (note: Hitori&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;happy&rdquo; is not the same as everyone else&rsquo;s). </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, there was another aspect to Kita that Hitori felt embarrassed about. See, Hitori knows how Kita&rsquo;s aura can draw people in and create happiness from nowhere. But the thing is, a certain other feeling has crept up on Hitori over the past few weeks. A warm feeling. A cozy feeling. A&hellip;romantic feeling?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori just gets upset thinking about that, and more so when she reads it in this fanfiction. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes, Hitori Gotoh, the self proclaimed water-flea, external loner, highway rock, introvert, was in love with Ikuyo Kita. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But how? </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori always tells people (the few people she knows) that she hates sappy things and &ldquo;youthful exuberance&rdquo;. How could she love someone? Especially when that someone is Ikuyo Kita? </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, it all started after the school festival. We&rsquo;re not going to talk about the &ldquo;diving incident&rdquo; here, but let&#39;s just say that Hitori injured herself and was in the infirmary. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita had come to visit her that day, and though Hitori normally freaked out and exploded around the sun incarnate, she actually felt calm for once. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori realized that she really appreciated how Kita came to check on her. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And even though Kita lied and forced her into the festival performance, she still ended up thankful for the experience (the concert itself, not the &ldquo;incident&rdquo; which happened after). </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So as Hitori and Kita sat calmly in that infirmary, Hitori began to think back to all of the other times she spent with Kita. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The popular girl was always quick to help Hitori become more familiar with the extroverted world. She knew how to give the pink darkness magnet all sorts of new experiences she would have never dreamed of, and never forced her to do any of it. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She thought back to how Kita was always praising her, focusing on her, taking in her lessons. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She thought about how cute the girl was, how her red hair always glowed in the sun, how her skin was always smooth and shiny, how her smile always seemed to make even the saddest individuals happy without fail. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori remembered her practices with Kita, where they would be close and critique each other&rsquo;s hand placements. At the time, those were just teaching moments, but now Hitori couldn&rsquo;t help but blush when thinking of them. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And lastly, Hitori liked how it sounded when Kita called her name. Yes, it was a simple thing, but just that simple action always made Hitori feel so warm. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori loved Ikuyo Kita. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, naturally, she came to love photographs. Why, you ask?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because Kita always took photos of herself, and she never failed to look pretty. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Again, Hitori always despised photos, they were the secret weapons of extroverts and youthful people. The camera lens was evil, a cursed object that bewitches even the most innocent individuals. So many introverts fell prey to its whims. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori is included in the &ldquo;many introverts&rdquo;. She was now taking photos like she never would. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, the subject was always one thing: Kita. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori has found a way to secretly take photos of the girl she loves. This is the only way she can express her love, because there&rsquo;s no way she could confess. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Introverts have their limits. Sure, she was bold enough to love the red haired sun in a jar, but not brave enough to say it out loud. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But it&rsquo;s not just her own lens she&rsquo;s looking through. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori is secretly following Kita on Instagram. She could never admit that to anyone, but it&rsquo;s true. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was something about Kita&rsquo;s smile, her skin, her hair, her&hellip;everything. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even her stylish outfits. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori has never been good at fashion and styles, but she couldn&rsquo;t deny that Kita&rsquo;s outfit choices were always cute. Maybe it was because the girl herself was cute. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But&hellip;a strange part of her mind always hopes that Kita will show a little bit of skin. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori was ashamed the first time she had this thought. Truthfully, she had crushes on other girls before (she preferred girls over boys), and did have some inappropriate thoughts about them. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, Hitori was a loner. She never thought she&rsquo;d ever gain any experience in that department, let alone being simply friends with those girls. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes, Hitori was just like anyone else with her desires, but she always had the foresight to block them away. Not once did she go further than hoping for skin. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And hopefully, it will stay that way.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A monday morning starts this story. Hitori Gotoh wakes up and rubs her eyes. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She never liked Mondays. They were the worst days of the week. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But there is one positive.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita always posts her weekend photos on Monday. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so Hitori naturally drifted over to Instagram and checked her feed. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ugh. Sappy things. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori stumbled through the cringe-inducing displays of youth and found Kita&rsquo;s photos. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, she didn&rsquo;t care what the photos were. All she cared about was the cute red girl that was in them. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori stops on a specific photo of Kita and stares for a while. It wasn&rsquo;t anything totally different from her other bright photos, but that didn&rsquo;t matter to Hitori. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita was smiling, Kita was cute, Kita was beautiful. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori couldn&rsquo;t help but blush as she stared at Kita&rsquo;s cheerful smile, her stylish light blue blouse, her shining red hair. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kita-san&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori muttered. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her eyes then drifted a little bit towards the bright girl&rsquo;s collarbone. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If only a few of the buttons on that blouse were undone&hellip;then she&rsquo;d be able to see&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re creepy, onee-chan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori nearly jumped out of her skin at the sound of her little sister Futari&rsquo;s voice. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;F-F-F-F-F-Futari!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Futari was peeking in through a crack in the door. Hitori stood up, prepared to lunge at the devil incarnate. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She grabs her by the shoulders, a panicked look in her eyes. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;D-don&rsquo;t tell anyone! D-don&rsquo;t tell anyone!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She cries, as Futari looks on amused. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mom, onee-chan is stalking her friend on Instagram!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The devil walking exclaims loudly. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori melts onto the floor. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&hellip;devil&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She murmurs. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It took a huge amount of sheer will for Hitori to get ready quickly. She knew that if she took any longer, her mother would ask about the &ldquo;stalking&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She wasn&rsquo;t stalking, was she? She was just&hellip;observing her friend that she likes so much. It&rsquo;s not like taking secret photographs, watching Instagram every second, and printing out the best photos was stalking, was it? </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">(Yeah, that&rsquo;s stalking, by definition.)</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes, Hitori kept printed photos of Kita, if you&rsquo;re wondering. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A phone screen, Hitori reasoned to herself, doesn&rsquo;t accurately showcase how beautiful Kita is. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So naturally she went to a convenience store and printed some photos, under the guise of &ldquo;special event photos&rdquo;. How Hitori managed to pull off that lie is a mystery that even she doesn&rsquo;t know the answer to. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But regardless, these photos were Hitori&rsquo;s prized possessions, and she kept them in a notebook where no one (presumably) would find them. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori arrived at school, as shy as ever, and sat down at her desk. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It had been a few weeks since the festival, but people were still coming up to her to compliment her guitar skills. She wasn&rsquo;t used to it. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, she had a natural distraction. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori opened up Instagram again, slightly frowning at her creepy tendencies, but continued nonetheless. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She notices that Kita has posted a new photo and views it. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita and some of her school friends were shown seated at a trendy cafe, with giant drinks that Hitori couldn&rsquo;t even begin to guess the name of. Not that she cared about that. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What she cared about was&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kita-san is&hellip;cute&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori mutters, staring intently at the bright girl pictured. Then she saw the faces of the other girls, and a random pout came upon her. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Huh? What was that? W-why am I pouting? </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori was understandably confused. She had never felt like this before. Why was she suddenly feeling upset? </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then it dawned on her&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">I&rsquo;m jealous?

They really were polar opposites, and yet&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about how much she wishes that she was the one in the photo with Kita instead of those friends.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">I want a photo like this with Kita-san&hellip;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yes, the loner Hitori was hoping she&rsquo;d be in a photo with the extrovert Kita. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;W-why am I acting so weird?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori groaned as she placed her head down on her desk. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7">Ding!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A phone alert brings her head back up. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori checks Instagram and sees that someone has sent her a DM. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">UNKNOWN: &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re the girl that Kita-chan often hangs out with, correct?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">HITORI: &ldquo;Y-yes&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">UNKNOWN: &ldquo;Great.

A bra! </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori&rsquo;s face turned bright red, almost as red as Kita&rsquo;s hair. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;B&hellip;bra&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She mutters. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The stranger sends her one final DM for good measure. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">UNKNOWN: &ldquo;Enjoy the eye candy!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori nearly slammed her head on her desk when she saw this message. Naturally, this attracted some curious eyes, but she paid them no heed. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">K&hellip;Kita-san&hellip;in a bra&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori felt like human garbage for what she was about to do, but she wasn&rsquo;t going to stop. She touched the photo, and saved it to her camera roll. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry, Kita-san&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori murmured to no one. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She goes to her camera roll and stares at the photo for a while. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She shouldn&rsquo;t be looking, this was totally non consensual. It was a freaking sneak-pic! But&hellip;she couldn&rsquo;t look away. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori stared and stared and stared, until her eyes were practically stained with the photo, and by the time that happened, it was already time for routine practice. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hitori-chan! Time for practice!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita exclaimed as she entered the classroom. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori immediately hid her phone and looked in the opposite direction as she nodded meekly. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Y-yes&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stands up robotically, but Kita doesn&rsquo;t seem to notice. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All the way down the hallway, to the spot where they usually practiced, Hitori walked super unnaturally, but again, Kita didn&rsquo;t seem to notice. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">(But she did, which was why she was smiling in amusement. But Hitori didn&rsquo;t know that.)</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When they got to the usual routine, everything seemed normal. Hitori was less touchy with her explanations, but Kita didn&rsquo;t care nor pay it any mind. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, Kita decided she would play a song to see how she would fare by herself. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori simply watched, entranced. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita was beautiful, a specimen of human that seemed designed for magnetizing all contact and interaction. She was a girl who looked pretty doing anything, even roughly strumming a guitar. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even with the spicy photo Hitori had received earlier, she couldn&rsquo;t deny that this was truly the most beautiful form of Ikuyo Kita. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, it seemed that her camera was out before she even could process the fact that she opened it. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The angle was perfect, the girl in front of her was perfect. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Hitori clicked the shutter on her phone. A discreet addition to the collection. </span><span class="c7 c12">SNAP&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c12 c7"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori froze. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita froze too, eyes wide. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh, um, uh&hellip;I&hellip;I&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori blurted out. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Were you&hellip;just taking a picture of me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita asks, a slight pink on the bridge of her nose. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&hellip;it&hellip;it was just&hellip;um&hellip;an album cover!

I&hellip;I thought&hellip;you would look good on a cover!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori completely lied through her teeth. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, she actually wasn&rsquo;t lying about Kita potentially looking good on an album cover. That was a genuine thought of hers. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita seemed to relax with a sheepish smile and chuckles. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;O-oh, I see. Haha&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori thought there was something suspicious about that response, but decided it was just her imagination. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Practice went as usual after that interruption, though the atmosphere was slightly awkward. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In fact, the atmosphere was super strained all the way up to them entering Club Starry after school. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori cursed herself for letting her impulses take control. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ahh! Kita-san must hate me now! I really drove her away this time, didn&rsquo;t I? Why did I insist on taking that stupid photo? Us introverts really shouldn&rsquo;t have cameras!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori shook her head in a goofy way, which drew curious eyes from her friend Nijika. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Um, you alright, Hitori-chan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She asks in slight concern. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeseverythingisfinenothingiswrongimjustanidiotsodontworryaboutmeok.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori rambled off, before rushing somewhere else to work alone. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nijika could only stare with an odd look of confusion. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is she freaking out about now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori practiced by herself, strumming randomly to clear her thoughts. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Getoutofmyhead! Getoutofmyhead!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She cried, her strumming getting faster, her focus wasn&rsquo;t even on what she was playing. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her friends stared at her in awe, marveling once again at the sheer talent of the lead guitarist. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s playing crazy good for someone who&rsquo;s distracted.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nijika says. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We should stop being surprised.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryo mutters. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ryo-senpai, do you think we could use this as a melody for a song?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita asked curiously. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hmm&hellip;no.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The blue haired girl said curtly. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That was fast.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nijika commented, disbelief in her eyes. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s good, but that&rsquo;s not song material.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryo continues. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey, we can&rsquo;t just write off her talent like this! Maybe we can include it somewhere!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita suggests. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing you can say that&rsquo;ll convince me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryo says, not budging. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Senpai!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As she strummed her guitar, Hitori watched as Kita and Ryo bickered. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The feeling from before makes a reappearance. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;T-this again&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori mutters. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stares longingly at Kita, frowning. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her playing turns somber, disjointed. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nijika notices the change and glances over at Hitori curiously. She can immediately see the glint in the guitarist&rsquo;s eyes and follows her gaze. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">All at once, understanding hits her like a truck. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ah, Hitori-chan likes Kita-san&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori suddenly stops playing. She goes over to the bar and grabs a drink of water. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">I love Kita-san, but she likes Ryo-senpai&hellip;they look so good together&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori&rsquo;s frown grows (if that&rsquo;s possible). </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She knew her feelings were dumb, stupid, impossible, and slightly gross. Kita-san was the sun, everyone could see that. Ryo-senpai was the moon. They eclipsed, which was why they worked. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori was Pluto. A planet that doesn&rsquo;t even get included in the count of planets. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were far apart, not even being close to compatible, and yet&hellip;why do her feelings persist? Why don&rsquo;t they disappear? Why does her mind tempt her with such desires? </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori had no clue. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Savor her, Ryo-senpai, savor that sunshine&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yeah, everyone could feel Hitori&rsquo;s depressive aura the whole day. At the same time, no one knew what they could do to help her. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita tried to understand why she was upset, but Hitori instantly teleported to different parts of the room when this happened. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">(How she managed this, no one knows, not even herself.)</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the end of the day, the mystery of Hitori&rsquo;s sadness had not been solved. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As soon as practice and work was over, Hitori was out the door in a flash. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She ran down the road at high speed, reaching the confines of her closet before anyone could see her or ask questions. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instinctively, her hands drifted towards her guitar, as she sought to distract herself with song. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But that didn&rsquo;t work. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Hitori played, her mind was plagued with thoughts of Kita practicing alongside her, sharing experiences with her, smiling brightly at her. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That warm feeling from before seemed to invade all reasonable thinking of the pink-haired girl, and once again she lamented their antithetical lives. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Kita-san will never l-love me. Why can&rsquo;t I just accept that? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori paused her playing, her hands starting to shake. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Why does it hurt? I&rsquo;m just&hellip;sidewalk dust&hellip;what&rsquo;s with these impossible hopes of mine?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Drip. Hitori heard the sound of water falling on her guitar. She places a hand up to her face and freaks out. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-huh? W-why am I crying? Stop it! Stop it!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori shook her head with the force of a tornado, trying to propel the sad thoughts out of her stupid foolish mind. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Getoutgetoutgetoutgetoutgetout!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori held her head, realizing her tears had gotten worse. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kita-san&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori grabs her notebook and opens it to a specific page. Several photos fall out, including a recently printed one&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The leaked photo of Kita looked back at the pink haired ball of darkness, filling her thoughts with all sorts of obscene things. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, Hitori knew better than to ask a convenience store clerk to print something like this. She printed it herself at a library. Not that that was any less embarrassing. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori stared, and stared, and stared, and stared, and stared, and&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You get the idea. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn&rsquo;t look away, she couldn&rsquo;t resist. Kinky photos like these always stimulated her (she looked at other things before), but this was someone she loved deeply.

And Hitori-chan is in p-possession of it? </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita was understandably flustered. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After all, it wasn&rsquo;t like she was perfect or infallible. She felt shaken just like any person and she had anxieties just like any introvert. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, her way of dealing with this was to become an extrovert, to gain friends, to become a bright star. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita knows the expectations that people put on her and she knows the way people talk behind her back. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But to go this far? A sneak photo in the girl&rsquo;s changing room? </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita couldn&rsquo;t help but blush upon remembering the embarrassing sight. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not that the photo was the worst part. No, the most frustrating part about all of this was the person who had said photo in their possession.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori Gotoh was a girl that Kita thought curious at first. She was extremely introverted, absurdly negative, and altogether depressing. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But her skill with a guitar was seemingly matched by no one. Kita was aware of that from her many practice sessions, but understood it more so after that school festival performance. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The naturally confident girl had felt her heart sink when she heard Hitori&rsquo;s guitar string snap on that big stage. So many emotions were flowing through her head, worried that their first real concert would be a failure, worried that everything she and Hitori had worked towards was for nothing. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her instinctive action was to buy time by extending her guitar playing. Little did she know what would happen after that. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori had picked up a wine glass and skirted the remaining strings with the skill and precision of an expert. It was like nothing Kita had ever seen before or even imagined. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And suddenly, Kita felt like something inside of her had changed. This feeling didn&rsquo;t go away, even after the &ldquo;diving incident&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was in the infirmary, where Hitori slept soundly, that a realization dawned on Kita&rsquo;s mind. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Hitori-chan&hellip;she&rsquo;s so&hellip;cool&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita couldn&rsquo;t help but smile that day, watching the pink haired girl sleep. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She ran her fingers through Hitori&rsquo;s hair, a new feeling filling her heart. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was when she suddenly understood everything. Why she always enjoyed meeting Hitori for practice, why she always loved taking Hitori out on trips, why she wanted the festival performance to go so well. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was because of a feeling. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">I&hellip;love you, Hitori-chan&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ikuyo Kita loved Hitori Gotoh. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course, Kita never told anyone about this discovery. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For how exuberant she was, Kita couldn&rsquo;t help how embarrassed the idea made her. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But most of all, she wanted to protect Hitori, she wanted to preserve her happiness. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If Kita suddenly confessed to youth-repelling Hitori, imagine what could happen. Everything would come crashing down, and Hitori would probably die for real. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So confessions could never happen, no matter how much Kita wanted to tell the pink-haired girl. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For Kita, having such feelings made things so difficult, especially during practice, where Hitori always helped her with hand placement. She was thankful that the alcove where they practiced was dark enough that Hitori couldn&rsquo;t see the red on her face.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But now, all reservations Kita had about her feelings were thrown out the window. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori had been looking at photos of her? She was saving inappropriate photos of her? </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita still had trouble believing it, but also most of all, she felt sort of happy about it. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Maybe&hellip;she likes me back&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s what she hoped. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today was Thursday, and Ikuyo Kita was confronting a nervous student in gym class. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Being the popular girl she was, many people were quick to help her when she told them about tracking down the perpetrator of the non-consensual photo. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so here she was, staring down a shaking young student. In a rare show of aggression, Kita was smiling maliciously. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She seemed normal, but at the same time, there was a clear negative aura ruminating from her inner thoughts. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita cleared her throat and started: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, I hear you&rsquo;ve been handing out pictures of me changing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She asks bluntly. The young student flinches. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I was just&hellip;you&rsquo;re so cute, I&hellip;I thought you needed to be seen, and&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita inched closer, her dark aura growing in scale. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And so you sent the photo, without my consent, to my instagram followers?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young student was on the brink of tears. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita didn&rsquo;t stop her offense. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m normally very cheerful, you know? But when someone does something gross like this, I can&rsquo;t let it slide. So here&rsquo;s my suggestion: delete all traces of that obscene photo, or you&rsquo;ll face a side of me you&rsquo;d wish you never did. How does that sound?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She asked passive-aggressively. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Several people who were in the vicinity quickly grabbed their phones and scrambled to delete something, as the girl being confronted nodded.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;I&rsquo;ll&hellip;delete it&hellip;I&rsquo;m so sorry!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The young student ran away in tears, as Kita finally relaxed. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There&rsquo;s only one person who will be allowed to have that photo&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She thought, as she smiled. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bystanders felt unnerved by the newly revealed fierceness of the redhead. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But Kita paid them no heed. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori Gotoh was crushed, annihilated, obliterated. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How could her secret be exposed? How could this happen so soon?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori shook her head, tears falling down her face. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;E-everyone&rsquo;s going to&hellip;hate me now&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She mused, as she laid her head down on her school desk.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The worst part? Hitori still had feelings for Kita. She couldn&rsquo;t push anything away. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">I have to forget about my feelings. I have to focus. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori kept telling herself this the whole way to school, and yet nothing came of it. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She still liked Kita. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It didn&rsquo;t help that the red-haired girl was pretty easy to see at school. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just one look at the popular girl brought all of the sappy thoughts back to the forefront of Hitori&rsquo;s mind. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">But no matter how much I like her&hellip;she likes Ryo-senpai&hellip;and she probably hates me now that she&rsquo;s seen those photos!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ever the pessimist, Hitori could not bring herself to talk to Kita the entire day. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If the redhead tried to talk to her, she would run off somewhere else. Even slight glances caused Hitori to disappear in an instant. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So naturally, she did not go to usual practice with Kita and instead found another place to eat lunch. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was sort of lonely, not being with the vocalist. They had always hung out ever since becoming friends, but now these horrible feelings that Hitori had were driving a wedge between them. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For the first time in a long while, Hitori Gotoh felt truly sad. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a fit of desperation, Hitori rummages through her backpack and pulls out a photo of Kita, staring at it longingly. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kita-san&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And before she could think about what she was doing, Hitori pressed her lips to the photo. It was weird, Hitori felt horrible, but she couldn&rsquo;t help but imagine that her and Kita were kissing. This stimulated her to a level she couldn&rsquo;t believe, but unfortunately&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H&hellip;Hitori-chan, w-what are you&hellip;?!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The voice of Kita shot through Hitori&rsquo;s chest like an arrow, and naturally she jumped nearly a foot in the air in surprise. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ahhhhhhh!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She cried, before fainting. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita shook Hitori&rsquo;s body worriedly. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hitori-chan, come on&hellip;wake up&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Getting no response, Kita sighed in resignation and then laid the pink-haired girl&rsquo;s head on her lap. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita slightly flushed. The feeling of giving a lap-pillow was certainly something, wasn&rsquo;t it? </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She smiles and runs her hand through Hitori&rsquo;s hair. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so cute, Hitori-chan&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She mutters. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wah!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori suddenly exclaims, sitting up in surprise. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H&hellip;Hitori-chan, welcome back&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita says, slightly stuttering. Hitori notices. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kita-san&hellip;did you&hellip;say I was&hellip;c-cute?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori asks, embarrassed. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita looks to the ground. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes&hellip;you don&rsquo;t like it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She frowns. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori throws her hands up in a panic. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry, Kita-san! I&rsquo;m so sorry! I&rsquo;m so sorry! I&rsquo;m so sorry!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori held her head down and apologized profusely for several minutes, as Kita watched, amused. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Hitori-chan. I&rsquo;m not angry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita says with a kind smile. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;R-really?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori asks, not altogether believing her. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, Kita pulls her into a hug. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;K-K-K-K-Kita-san?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She cried in surprise. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita rubbed her back slowly, savoring the feeling of their embrace. She leans into Hitori&rsquo;s ear and whispers. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hitori-chan, I&rsquo;m actually really happy, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She says. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;H-happy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori asks. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita nods. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I love you, Hitori-chan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She admits. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori felt like she was going to faint again, but held herself together. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;L-love&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She shakily asks. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Y-yeah&hellip;you know, I was a little bit upset about those photos, but not for the reason you think.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori frowns again. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;So you </span><span class="c5">were</span><span>&nbsp;upset&hellip;I really </span><span class="c5">am</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;a horrible person&hellip;gross individual&hellip;disgusting incel&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita suddenly kisses Hitori on the lips, which elicits wide eyes from the guitarist. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Kita-san is&hellip;k-kissing&hellip;me&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&hellip;s-so s-soft&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The contact only lasted a few seconds, but to Hitori, it felt like an eternity.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t upset that you had them, Hitori-chan. I was upset because&hellip;I would have rather you asked me to show my p-provocative side in person&hellip;rather than looking through a photo&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita mutters with a blush. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori doesn&rsquo;t know what to say to this. What she was suggesting&hellip;it goes far beyond the level of simple curiosity. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, Hitori-chan&hellip;do you feel the same way about me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita asked, hopeful for a positive answer. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori thought for a moment, and then nodded meekly. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Y-yes&hellip;I love you, Ki&hellip;Ikuyo-chan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She says, before kissing the red-haired girl herself. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita&rsquo;s eyes went wide at the uncharacteristic romanticism (and the use of her first name) from the guitarist, but didn&rsquo;t protest it. She held Hitori close, as their exploration grew deeper and more passionate. Tongues came into the mix, and eventually whimpers could be heard. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After what felt like hours (but was actually several minutes), Hitori and Kita parted to catch their breath. Both musicians had red faces, hitched breaths, and extremely dirty thoughts. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, Kita decided to pop the hot question: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, Hitori-chan&hellip;would you like to see how provocative I can be?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori&rsquo;s blush grew darker, as she shyly nodded.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Y-yes&hellip;b-but, before that&hellip;can I get a photo with you, Ikuyo-chan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She asks. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita was surprised to hear this, but she smiled and held her close. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, Hitori-chan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She says, and then pulls out her phone to capture the both of them. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They then looked at the finished result and smiled. For once, a photo with Hitori in it didn&rsquo;t look like a creepypasta sighting, but instead resembled a scene of peak youth. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ugh. Hitori Gotoh was becoming youthful. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That afternoon, at Club Starry&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nijika and Ryo noticed that their lead guitarists were getting pretty touchy with each other. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita was wiping Hitori&rsquo;s sweat every five seconds, Hitori was physically correcting Kita&rsquo;s hand placement, they even took photos together as they played. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They laughed, they talked, Hitori&rsquo;s usual stuttering was barely present. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even during work hours, Kita offered to help Hitori with orders, and once or twice they got really close. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting better at handling customers, Hitori-chan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s thanks to you, Ikuyo-chan&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s because of how hard you try, Hitori-chan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t try this hard if you weren&rsquo;t helping me, Ikuyo-chan&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone could practically see the floating hearts and stars around them. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Naturally, all in the vicinity were annoyed. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re pretty insufferable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ryo commented bluntly. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Get a room, you dumb lovebirds!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nijika cried in frustration. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Club manager Seika placed a hand on her little sister&rsquo;s shoulder. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nah, let&rsquo;s watch them a bit more&hellip;it&rsquo;s kind of interesting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Onee-chan!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Nijika and Seika continued to banter, Kita pulled Hitori aside and whispered into her ear: </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, should I sleep over tonight, babe?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She asks slyly. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, y-yeah, that&rsquo;s fine&mdash; wait, b-babe?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori cried in surprise. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita then kisses her on the ear, which elicits a dry moan. Hitori covers her mouth at the unexpected sound. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, you are my babe, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita asks sneakily, wrapping her arms around the pink haired girl. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Um&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, that&rsquo;s enough of that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seika suddenly exclaims, interrupting their intimate conversation. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How about you two get to work, instead of flirting? This is a music club, not a sex club.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori coughs violently, Kita&rsquo;s face turns a bright red, almost as bright as her hair. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;L-let&rsquo;s get to work!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They cried shakily, robotically making their way back to their work stations. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At last, the work day was over. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori and Kita were absolutely exhausted, having gained extra work due to their flirting. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, Ikuyo-chan&hellip;um&hellip;are we actually&hellip;going to&hellip;do it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori asks. It was Kita&rsquo;s turn to cough violently. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A-ah&hellip;if you&rsquo;re okay with it&hellip;then probably&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita responds with a blush. Hitori blushes in turn. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No other words were said after that. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After Kita made a detour to grab some clothes, they entered the quiet Gotoh house and tiptoed over to Hitori&rsquo;s bedroom. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori locked the door, which made Kita&rsquo;s blush darken. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once all was said and done, the two musicians were woefully unprepared. They didn&rsquo;t know where to start, they felt absolutely embarrassed, and also were hesitant to undress. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eventually, Kita bit the bullet, and undid her neckerchief. She slowly removes her shirt, and then faces Hitori with a blush. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Y-you can look all you want, Hitori-chan&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She muttered. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori&rsquo;s eyes were locked onto the shirtless Kita with a thousand dirty thoughts. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">W&hellip;what should I do? </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori panicked, not knowing the next move, but on instinct, she decided to start simple. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She leaned in and kissed Kita on the lips. Kita reciprocates her love by wrapping her hands around her back. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori&rsquo;s hands then slid downwards, slowly touching Kita&rsquo;s breasts. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita squirmed. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I-is this okay, Ikuyo-chan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori asks nervously. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita nods, her face red and her eyes closed. Hitori accepted her consent and continued touching the area for a while. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, Kita grabs one of her hands and rests it inside of her skirt. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ikuyo&hellip;chan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori couldn&rsquo;t believe this. What was happening? Was she really going this far? </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&hellip;hold back&hellip;Hitori-chan&hellip;I&rsquo;m all yours, babe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita says with a loopy smile. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori was extremely hesitant, but Kita&rsquo;s aroused words caused all of her desires to take over, reaching into the red-haired girl&rsquo;s panties carefully. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita flinched, but let Hitori continue. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Safe to say, her finger talent with the guitar matched equally with her talent in bed. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita had climaxed four times that night. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They did trade places, but Kita was slightly tired, so Hitori had a quicker experience. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was still an experience nonetheless, and Hitori was actually thankful for once that her bust was so big. Normally it just got in the way when playing guitar, but when Kita&rsquo;s hands hit her nerve buds, she climaxed almost instantly. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita&rsquo;s finger game was slightly less skilled than Hitori, but the pink haired girl loved it despite that. She came three times that night. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori and Kita woke the next day, confused as to why they were sleeping together naked, before they remembered the events of last night. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Both girls blushed, and then smiled. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve really done it now, huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita asked with a grin. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori nodded. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;thank you for&hellip;l-letting me s-see you, Ikuyo-chan&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She mutters with a shameless smile. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita hugs Hitori and runs her hand through the lead guitarist&rsquo;s hair. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, babe. I love you, after all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She says with a loving smile. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They sat there in a warm embrace for a while, before Hitori broke the silence. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Um&hellip;can I get another photo with you, Ikuyo-chan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She asks. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita smiles mischievously. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re getting bold, Hitori-chan. I never thought you were the kinky type who liked naked selfies&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori flails her arms back and forth. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not&hellip;I&hellip;I just wanted to p-preserve this moment&hellip;It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m interested in n-naked selfies!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She exclaims. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita giggles. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so cute when you&rsquo;re flustered.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She pulls out her phone. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sure, let&#39;s preserve this memory, Hitori-chan. It&rsquo;ll be a memory just for us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita and Hitori take a picture together. Once again, Hitori didn&rsquo;t hate it, even though she was naked this time. It just felt right to her. She liked it. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So&hellip;shall we head to school, babe?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kita asks with a smile. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori nods. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, Ikuyo-Chan.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, a sound by the door startles them. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori&rsquo;s little sister Futari was peeking through a crack with a blush on her face. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori goes to say, but it was too late. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mom, onee-chan is no longer a virgin!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The little devil in children&rsquo;s clothing exclaims with a fiendish smile. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hitori and Kita both faint. </span></p></body></html>
