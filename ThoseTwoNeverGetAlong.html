Despite the workplace&rsquo;s usual monotony, today was an exception&mdash;a burst of warmth and levity in an otherwise draining environment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">February fourteenth, twenty twenty five.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The scent of chocolate mixed with the sterile tang of printer ink. Roses sat on desks, nestled between stacks of reports, and colorful greeting cards peeked out from keyboards. Laughter echoed softly between cubicles, as coworkers exchanged small gifts and well-wishes. Even the harshest deadlines felt a little less suffocating.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But not everyone had been swept up in the cheerful camaraderie.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;You missed something,&rdquo; Theo remarked, dropping a stack of papers onto a desk with a dull </span><span class="c6">thud</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Lena glanced up from her monitor, eyes narrowing. &ldquo;You could have just emailed me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And you could have caught your mistake before I had to fix it,&rdquo; Theo shot back, arms crossed. &ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t. I guess you&rsquo;re a magnet for mistakes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;One missing data entry is not the end of the world, asshole,&rdquo; Lena snapped, grabbing the papers with an exaggerated roll of her eyes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very unprofessional language,&rdquo; Theo countered smoothly. &ldquo;I could write you up for that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You sound awfully sure of that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Around them, coworkers exchanged knowing glances. These two&mdash;Theo and Lena&mdash;were infamous, their arguments a reliable fixture in the office landscape. Where there was one, the other was never far behind, their sharp words bouncing off each other relentlessly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Those two never get along,&rdquo; someone muttered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">But that was not true at all. They got along better than anyone there.</span></p><hr><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the end of the day, Theo and Lena left the office, still glaring at each other. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They entered the subway station, still glaring at each other. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They sat on the train, steadfastly ignoring each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A nearby workmate noticed them and chuckled. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t even leave the office without hating each other. I wonder where they&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">But that was not true at all. And they were going to the exact same place.</span></p><hr><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was quiet and peaceful that night. But it was only 5:30. The night was still young.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lena walked into a modern-looking condo, setting her bag down before heading straight for the kitchen. She opened the fridge and retrieved a small, neatly wrapped box of chocolates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seconds later, Theo walked into a modern-looking condo, setting down his bag and turning to the kitchen to see the fridge open. Lena was standing there with a smile on her face. He sauntered over, his tired expression turning into a smirk. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You were particularly ruthless today,&rdquo; he said, chuckling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;I may have gotten a </span><span class="c6">little</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;carried away&hellip;&rdquo; Lena replied sheepishly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;A little?&rdquo; Theo hugged her from behind. &ldquo;You called me an </span><span class="c6">asshole</span><span class="c1">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lena shrunk into his arms shyly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; Lena nodded numbly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dummy.&rdquo; He ruffled her hair with affection.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Lena pouted before smiling. &ldquo;Happy Valentine&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she said, turning in his arms and holding up the box. &ldquo;I made these for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Theo accepted the gift, opening it with genuine delight. He popped a chocolate into his mouth, savoring it. &ldquo;I did the same,&rdquo; he admitted, reaching into the fridge to retrieve an identical box.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Lena grinned. &ldquo;Great minds think alike.&rdquo; She took a piece and bit into it. Immediately, her face lit up. &ldquo;Oh! It&rsquo;s dark chocolate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Just the way you like it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Her smile softened, and she leaned into him. &ldquo;Did you prepare the wine?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the cooler outside.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Lena sighed, stretching. &ldquo;Man, I&rsquo;m so tired. I just want to go out and relax.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Theo chuckled. &ldquo;Shall we, then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She smirked. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">This was how they truly were. But no one at the workplace would know that.</span></p><hr><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The motor of a balcony hot tub rumbled, as Lena and Theo sat inside. They smiled at each other, clinked their glasses together, took a sip of wine each, and then kissed under the moonlight. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Has your dad responded yet?&rdquo; she asked, her voice soft but probing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Theo&rsquo;s smirk faded slightly. &ldquo;He keeps dodging the subject every time I bring up marriage.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Lena sighed. &ldquo;I thought we had gotten through to him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You know how particular he is,&rdquo; Theo muttered, rubbing his temple. &ldquo;Remember how long it took just for him to accept us living together?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t really mind it,&rdquo; Lena said with a smile, kissing him again, before leaning against him. &ldquo;I can wait for as long as it takes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Theo smiled. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lena smiled back. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s obvious.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aw, I was hoping you would say it back,&rdquo; Theo said playfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do I have to?&rdquo; Lena asked teasingly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It would be appreciated.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lena laughed. &ldquo;Dummy, you already know how much I love you,&rdquo; she said, leaning in to kiss him once more. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They kissed for a while, the cool nighttime air washing over them as their Valentine&rsquo;s Day rendezvous continued&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">They got along very well. Only they knew it, but it was fine that way. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
