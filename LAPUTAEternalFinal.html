They aren&rsquo;t exactly lovers, but they seem to be more than just regular friends at the same time. What does it mean to live together? Why is it that the idea feels so natural to them, despite the implications? Such questions are unfamiliar to them, and so while they don&rsquo;t mind each other&rsquo;s company, they also don&rsquo;t know if that means something more. But one day, their personal problems are tossed aside, as Sheeta receives a mysterious letter from someone she&rsquo;s never met before. On top of that, the letter contains a familiar symbol they both easily recognize. Now Sheeta and Pazu are out on an adventure to find the mysterious sender, who may be related to the lost people of Laputa, while also coping with newfound feelings that are blossoming between them. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.pz19e3bgof7"><span class="c7">Preface</span></h3><p class="c21"><span class="c12">The settings and characters in this story are property of Studio Ghibli.

A brisk dew settled on the fresh spring grass, sparkling with the shining rays.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lumbering Yaks grazed contently, while lively birds sang merry songs along the needled trees. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amidst the picturesque landscape, a small farmhouse sat bathed in the warm glow of dawn, its exterior aging, yet perfectly quaint. Barely visible wisps of smoke rose slowly from the stone chimney, with the smells of fresh bacon, crisp toast and fried eggs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A young boy of fifteen emerged from the front door, fixing his brown leather cap and rubbing his tired eyes. With his other hand, he took a bite of toast he was carrying, looking out into the distance with a calm smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For Pazu, this was the perfect life. He had a wonderful view everyday, he had consistently replenishing farm products, and he didn&rsquo;t have to worry about mining work anymore. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On top of that, he got to experience all of this with someone who understood him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Morning.&rdquo; Said a voice from behind. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A girl with short pigtails joined Pazu at his side. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Morning!&rdquo; He responded with a bright grin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It had been two years since he and Sheeta became cohabitants. For them, it seemed the most obvious next step, as they got along well and trusted each other more than anyone else in the world. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet, there was just one problem they couldn&rsquo;t figure out. A problem that was pretty arbitrary on the surface, but occupied their thoughts almost every day&hellip; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What exactly were they?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After living together for two years, could you still consider them friends?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They thought about these questions all the time, yet&hellip;whenever they got close to any answers, they would try to distract themselves from the subject. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">On that warm, dew-filled morning, Pazu and Sheeta glanced at each other, thinking the same thing in unison: </span><span class="c6 c17">Should I ask her/him?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But of course they wouldn&rsquo;t. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu broke the silence unexpectedly, saying: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, uh&hellip;what&rsquo;s on the agenda today, Sheeta?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta, appreciating the new subject, breathed an inner sigh of relief. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I believe we need to check on the crops first. At the very least, the tomatoes should be ready for harvest, and the carrots could use a final watering. We don&rsquo;t want to miss the market this afternoon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu nodded. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right. With this season&rsquo;s produce, we may even be able to trade more goods than usual.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta eyed him with a playful smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, and you might finally get the tools needed to finish that project of yours.&rdquo; She said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu chuckled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping!&rdquo; He exclaimed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta giggled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re that excited about it, why don&rsquo;t we get started then?&rdquo; She asked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; Pazu responded. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Together, they worked side by side in the vast fields of the farm. Their laughter mingled amongst the windy reeds and buzzing insects. As they collected various amounts of sellable produce, Sheeta couldn&rsquo;t help but steal glances at Pazu, amused at the way his brow furrowed as he worked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To her, she seemed to always finding reasons to be thankful for him every day. She couldn&rsquo;t imagine a person she&rsquo;d ever trust more&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But with this, came feelings she never knew. Feelings she never experienced. Feelings&hellip;that scared her more than anything in the world. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, Pazu was the most important person in Sheeta&rsquo;s life&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But these feelings she had&hellip;she worried they would create a division&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She didn&rsquo;t fully understand what it all meant, but she felt that if she told him, he might not accept it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was scary. That was a scenario she didn&rsquo;t ever want to experience. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So she kept it all to herself.</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once their harvest was finished, Pazu and Sheeta loaded up their produce onto a small cart and began the journey into town. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gondoa&rsquo;s town wasn&rsquo;t a big city by any means, but for a settlement in the hills, it was pretty sizable. The streets were bustling with activity, as merchants rushed to set up stalls and children played carelessly. Sheeta smiled at the familiar faces that greeted them, feeling a sense of belonging she hadn&rsquo;t felt in a long time. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the marketplace, they set up their wares for all to see. The townsfolk were quick to flock to their stand, eager for the high quality products that Sheeta&rsquo;s farm produced. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, Sheeta and Pazu! It&rsquo;s good to see you two once again!&rdquo; Exclaimed Mrs. Osono, an elderly woman with a twinkle in her eye. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re pleased to have your business!&rdquo; Pazu said playfully, eliciting laughter from everyone. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh Pazu, you shouldn&rsquo;t be so blunt!&rdquo; Sheeta laughed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mrs. Osono beamed at Sheeta, a tenderness in her eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My dear Sheeta, I&rsquo;m so happy to see you smiling again. It&rsquo;s been so long.&rdquo; She said with a hand on her heart. The townsfolk around her nodded in agreement. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was common knowledge that Sheeta had lost all of her living relatives at a young age. In the years following, she had been rather depressed and lonely. They could see it in her eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But these days, Sheeta was all smiles. It was clear to them that Pazu had brought joy to the little pigtailed girl who was always alone. And that made them so happy for her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta returned Mrs. Osono&rsquo;s smile, her eyes shining with gratitude. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Osono. All of this wouldn&rsquo;t be possible without Pazu.&rdquo; She replied softly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu chuckled bashfully. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And I wouldn&rsquo;t be here if it wasn&rsquo;t for you, Sheeta. You weren&rsquo;t the only lonely one&hellip;&rdquo; He muttered. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mrs. Osono eyed the two kids curiously, and then grinned in understanding. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can see that you two have a great connection. I hope you&rsquo;ll stay together and protect one another.&rdquo; She said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta and Pazu glanced at each other upon hearing her words, and smiled without saying anything. </span></p><hr><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That night, they enjoyed a nice dinner at a local tavern. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a calm dinner, but that was all they really needed. Plus, the food was great. What more could they ask for? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Slowly, they savored every last bit of food on their plates. The silence between them was incredibly deafening. That is, until Sheeta broke the silence&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Pazu&hellip;&rdquo; She started. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are we?&rdquo; Sheeta asked, causing Pazu to nearly choke on his food. He hadn&rsquo;t expected her to broach the subject so bluntly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well&hellip;friends, right?&rdquo; He suggested after a while. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta frowned. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it strange though? To be living together like this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.ohyohaqhnb95"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind it. Do you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.wyiowzwyx5zr"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m fine with it, I just&hellip;I just wonder whether this means anything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.5l3ij8grzuk2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course it means something. It means our bond is strong. My father always told me that having good bonds makes for good living.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.on2af7j5qenp"><span class="c0">Sheeta looked to the ground and then sighed. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.tj14li877gzv"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you sacrificing for me, Pazu?&rdquo; She asked in a whisper. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.ybsmtxhnkxv1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? What makes you say that?&rdquo; Pazu asked in surprise. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.il5517hdkc8u"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You being here&hellip;you could return to your home, but you chose to stay with me.&rdquo; Sheeta explained. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.9k8p6bkazdh3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sheeta, I stay because I want to. You wanna know why I want to? Because you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.41sf0ugv0163"><span class="c0">Sheeta smiled bashfully.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.xqbht6a94b85"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And I am happy you&rsquo;re here. I just feel&hellip;unfamiliar with living alongside someone who isn&rsquo;t family.&rdquo; She explains. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.on63jtvod3n5"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I would be lying if I said I didn&rsquo;t feel the same.&rdquo; Pazu nodded in understanding. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silence seemed to reign over them following this conversation. They had discussed their feelings briefly, yet&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They still hadn&rsquo;t touched the subject of their relationship. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was just too daunting of a topic for dinner. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Walking home from town, they heard the familiar chirps of crickets, and the darkness was illuminated with the twinkling of stars above. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Staring up at the beautiful night sky, Sheeta had come to a small conclusion. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">I want to be more for Pazu. I want to mean something to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it was only a conclusion. She didn&rsquo;t know whether she meant it or not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sheeta, we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lost in her thoughts, she didn&rsquo;t realize they had already reached home. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That was fun, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; She asked with a smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu nodded, grinning. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You have great people here, Sheeta. This is a wonderful place.&rdquo; He said. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta giggled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to hear that.&rdquo; She responded. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They approached the front door, but before entering, Sheeta suddenly realized something. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, I forgot to check the mailbox.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She walked over and quickly opened it, and what she found caused her to freeze in her tracks. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;...what is this?&rdquo; She asked aloud in shock.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu joined her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is something wrong?&rdquo; He asked curiously. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta slowly nodded, holding up a green envelope. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu&rsquo;s eyes went wide. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Embossed in gold on the front of the green envelope was an unmistakable emblem that could only represent one thing: Laputa. </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.nv58heookf5e"><span class="c15">Chapter II - Letters From Afar</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta paced relentlessly in the kitchen, her mind racing with thoughts that just wouldn&rsquo;t settle. She bit her lip as she mulled over the situation, lost in the maze that was her feelings. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From his seat at the wooden dinner table, Pazu watched her with a chuckle, amusement dancing in his eyes. He took a sip of tea before addressing her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sheeta, if you keep pacing like that, you&rsquo;ll wear a hole in the floor. Why don&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a heavy sigh, Sheeta dropped into the chair beside him, her face drawn into a hard frown. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry, it&rsquo;s just&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu reached out and gave her a pat on the back, his expression softening in understanding. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Things have certainly gotten complicated, haven&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta gave a small nod.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I thought it was all over&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She glanced at the tension-inducing letter again, her lips pursing as she read its contents for the second time:</span></p><table class="c28"><tr class="c26"><td class="c29" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c20 c6 c18">Dear Lucita,</span></p><p class="c22" id="h.wfzst7r1a3zd"><span class="c20 c6 c18">I hope this letter is received in good tidings. I address this to you in hopes that you may attend a special event in the city of Eterna. As my special guest, you will receive the grandest hospitality and an opportunity to learn more about your heritage. </span></p><p class="c22" id="h.wcee1vtn8r36"><span class="c20 c6 c18">The event will occur in five days from now. If you wish to attend, please do so.

I have also included an extra ticket for any guest you wish to bring along.</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c13" id="h.nf69gkpehbde"><span class="c0">Sheeta&rsquo;s head fell into her hands, as she felt the overwhelming weight of the situation. Her mind felt like it was on the verge of collapse. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.wv01k0xifuo3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I had more family all this time&hellip;?&rdquo; she murmured, her voice filled with disbelief. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.l6dxtbo7gsxb"><span class="c0">The room seemed to close in on her as she tried to process the revelation. Family? The word was as foreign as the name &ldquo;Lucita&rdquo; that Xu had used to address her. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.v3a11flvaak0"><span class="c0">To Sheeta, the concept of family was like a distant memory. As far as she was concerned, her family died with her grandmother. And she only knew herself by the name &ldquo;Lucita&rdquo; under special circumstances. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.uwb73jcq9bac"><span class="c0">Pazu leaned forward, sensing Sheeta&rsquo;s inner turmoil. Her feelings were clearly etched all over her face. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.1qualtq9bmd5"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sheeta, what does the letter say exactly?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.d1fn9j59r4r1"><span class="c0">She handed him the letter, her hands trembling slightly. Pazu took it and read it carefully, his brow furrowing deeper with each line. When he finished, he placed the letter gently on the table, meeting her eyes with a mix of curiosity and worry. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.niefkl4g57bz"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you think&hellip;it&rsquo;s genuine?&rdquo; he asked, tapping the table thoughtfully. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.hveicmxrrzme"><span class="c0">Sheeta shrugged, feeling entirely helpless. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Surely someone wouldn&rsquo;t go this far just to deceive me, right? That wouldn&rsquo;t make any sense.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.oez2ybijhh3p"><span class="c0">Pazu nodded, weighing the possibilities. &ldquo;Xu seems to know something about your heritage, far more than a normal person would. Maybe there&rsquo;s some value in hearing what he has to say.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.5cby46pzdggr"><span class="c0">Sheeta considered his words, her gaze drifting to the enclosed tickets. &ldquo;But&hellip;what if it&rsquo;s a trap? What if he has ulterior motives?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.wzfot6fsq2kc"><span class="c0">Pazu grimaced. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t exactly rule out that possibility.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.k89l0kt99fik"><span class="c0">They both frowned, the decision laid before them seeming overly paramount. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.gdoaw4yjq8l2"><span class="c0">Sighing, Sheeta reached out and grabbed Pazu&rsquo;s hand, with a look on her face that he couldn&rsquo;t quite identify. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.whdpks28we8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Pazu&hellip;be honest&hellip;what do you think I should do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.70qff61owp8y"><span class="c12">Pazu hesitated, lost in thought for a moment, before speaking. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.ml5wb4wicakx"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well&hellip;this decision is not to be taken lightly,&rdquo; he began, his tone thoughtful. &ldquo;On one hand, this gives you an opportunity to learn more about your ancestors. But at the same time, you&rsquo;ve already gone through so much with Laputa, that getting more involved would cause further hurt. In the end, this is all up to you, but&hellip;I say we should go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.38yr2s7vu8uq"><span class="c0">Sheeta considered his words, resting her head gently on his shoulder.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.hb71gohmd2ol"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You really think so?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.gcok04wam5x"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah. It wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to learn, would it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.z7f178jg9l81"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip;suppose&hellip;I&rsquo;m just scared of what we&rsquo;ll find&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.5t4fwwcc5l91"><span class="c0">Pazu wrapped his arm around her, holding her tenderly. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.lt51v9mn2209"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sheeta&hellip;if you don&rsquo;t want to go, you don&rsquo;t have to. Just know I&rsquo;ll follow you no matter what you decide.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.9ekazg44dvll"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Pazu&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.qowil52lac9r"><span class="c0">As she relaxed in Pazu&rsquo;s embrace, Sheeta felt like she knew what she wanted to do. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.lf4di86usucw"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip;I want to go. I feel like something&rsquo;s calling me there&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.dygwczmxo3iz"><span class="c0">Pazu smiled, tightening his embrace.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.rf45viywvimx"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo; </span></p><hr><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The following days passed in a blur of preparations. Produce was harvested a few weeks in advance, the animals were fed overly well, and the entire house was cleaned thoroughly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta and Pazu packed their bags with only the necessary essentials. All the while, a looming sense of uncertainty filled the air. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where was this path leading them? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What would they find in Eterna? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta was fearful, but she also felt a growing sense of anticipation. The unknown was certainly daunting, but she felt ready to face it, if only for the fact that Pazu was by her side. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The morning of their departure was full of perfect elements. The sun was bright, the sky was clear, and the air was as clean as can be. These were prime conditions for traveling. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta took a deep breath, clutching her ticket tightly as she stood outside their home. Pazu stood beside her, making some last minute checks before he carefully locked the door. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; he asked, an eager smile on his face. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She nodded hesitantly, looking back at the house before taking a determined breath. &ldquo;Ready.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So began the slow journey towards Eterna. The first step of their travels took them back into town. They were greeted by the usual townsfolk, who couldn&rsquo;t contain their curiosity. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, if it isn&rsquo;t Sheeta and Pazu. Where are you two going with all those bags?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going on a vacation. Someone invited us!&rdquo; Sheeta responded. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After saying their goodbyes, Sheeta and Pazu found themselves in the upper part of town. Compared to the rest, this place was full of people. Tourists, businessmen, and regular civilians crowded the streets. In the distance, their destination, the town airport, loomed like the final fortress of a long labyrinth. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they approached, they caught sight of a large airship, which was the transportation they were eventually set to ride in. Sheeta hesitated slightly, remembering unsavory memories. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I never thought I would be on one of those again&hellip;&rdquo; she muttered, frowning. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu patted her shoulder encouragingly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m by your side this time.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta smiled and took his hand. &ldquo;Stay by me, Pazu.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He nodded, leading her to the point of their departure. However, as they were in sight of the airport, something caught his eye and he quickly pulled her aside, an urgent look on his face. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Sheeta asked curiously. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Look there.&rdquo; Pazu whispered, motioning to the airport entrance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta followed his gaze and froze, her eyes wide in shock and fear. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;P-Pazu&hellip;&rdquo; She cowered behind him, shaking intensely. Pazu hugged her, softly consoling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He couldn&rsquo;t blame her for being upset, because he was also incredibly angry at what he saw. It wasn&rsquo;t long since they last ran into conflicts with the Army, but for the first time in two years, they once again had the displeasure of seeing those horrible green uniforms. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, they had no reason to fear the Army in this current time, but what if those soldiers started asking questions? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What if the Army considered them fugitives for what happened in Laputa? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The risk was just too high for them both. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From where they were hiding, the chance of being immediately spotted and interrogated was one hundred percent. Sheeta felt totally helpless. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What should we do?&rdquo; she whispered fearfully. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait for the right moment.&rdquo; responded Pazu, grimacing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They carefully waited, wondering when they&rsquo;d get the chance to sneak by. As they did so, they slowly began to make out some of the conversation between the soldiers. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.vwdeqmwzb28w"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just so unbelievable. I mean, how can such a massive unit go missing without any kind of trace?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.2noyvq5ka576"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, if you ask me, I think they were all a bunch of fools, going after a city that doesn&rsquo;t even exist.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.chhcce556j2i"><span class="c0">&ldquo;True. But they had the Goliath going for them. Even if they got lost, they would still leave a path to follow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.p4cd9453rlc5"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Unless a bunch of happy-go-lucky sky pirates shot &lsquo;em down right over the sea.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.ktf3o31vtnb4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You really think it was pirates?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.z9he2tk50vtz"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sure I do. You&rsquo;ve heard the rumors, right? Even after all those skirmishes, the Dola Gang is still causing trouble, and their ship is now more formidable than the last.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.i84syh7nd6r4"><span class="c0">A third soldier joined the conversation.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.4p8kid49bd4p"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, regardless of what happened, there&rsquo;s no denying how poorly it&rsquo;s being handled.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.jbnhrp9tazs0"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh, tell me about it. A whole unit vanishes into thin air, and they act like it never happened. The higher ups are so incompetent these days.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.6u1rg373ezmp"><span class="c0">One soldier shook his head in frustration.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.phonpq46lucb"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re absolutely right. With their terrible judgment and ridiculous oversight, things have gone for the worse. I can&rsquo;t even walk into a small town without receiving dirty looks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.srjcxcija9ks"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I feel you. They blame us like we planned the mission, or we used more action than necessary. They don&rsquo;t even know the full truth about anything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.633f8jsywevr"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To be fair, neither do we.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.v9ed92i569fl"><span class="c0">They all sighed in unison. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.p7vzpl6kz27g"><span class="c0">Back in their hiding spot, Pazu and Sheeta sat in stunned silence. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.4qxwupn6t4vb"><span class="c0">Though they had come to despise the Army as a result of their actions in and around Laputa, not once did either of them consider the true aftermath of everything that transpired all those years ago. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.wab1ku5ggtzd"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is&hellip;I never imagined there was this much going on&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.wapqlrupkwpw"><span class="c0">Pazu muttered in surprise. Then he noticed Sheeta was looking to the ground with a hard frown.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.y64m0hm5qvtx"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sheeta? What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.xipxb5ha70cf"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;it&rsquo;s all my fault&hellip;&rdquo; She muttered sadly.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.bdexmv4ngk5c"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.lqiefsto0ky3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Those people&hellip;all those soldiers on Laputa&hellip;they all died because of me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.pwhcwjwx2p6h"><span class="c0">Pazu shook his head.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.ogb5dxj7ufzt"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sheeta, don&rsquo;t say that. The actions of a madman aren&rsquo;t related to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.bq2d12hhw4d7"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But&hellip;but I could have stopped him! I could have&hellip;.I could have warned them earlier&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.9wywk3jt0am1"><span class="c0">Pazu placed a hand on her shoulder. He glanced at the entrance, noticing the path was clear.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.s69509lhv8es"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The soldiers are gone. Let&rsquo;s go somewhere and sit.&rdquo; He suggested. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.ob4st5qvlitc"><span class="c0">Sheeta nodded silently and took his hand. </span></p><hr><p class="c1 c9" id="h.6h6xw61kh89o"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta and Pazu entered the bustling airport, cautiously scanning the crowds in order to avoid any Army confrontations. After quickly presenting their tickets at the check-in counter, they made their way to a quiet corner and found a bench to sit on. Sheeta remained silent, her face somber and her mind full of anxiety.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Noticing her distress, Pazu left briefly and returned with a steaming cup of hot tea. He handed it to Sheeta with a gentle smile. &ldquo;Here, this might help.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta accepted the cup gratefully, wrapping her hands around its warmth, but said nothing. She took a sip, the soothing drink slightly easing her tension, but her inner melancholy remained. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu watched her closely, concerned and worried. &ldquo;Sheeta, I can tell something&rsquo;s really bothering you. You&rsquo;ve been so quiet. What&#39;s the matter?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta hesitated, her eyes fixed on the surface of her drink. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s&hellip;something I haven&rsquo;t told you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m listening.&rdquo; he assured, giving her his undivided attention. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta took a deep, shaky breath as she continued. &ldquo;Ever since we left Laputa, I&rsquo;ve been having nightmares. They&rsquo;re so vivid&hellip;I can&rsquo;t shake them. It&rsquo;s been two years, Pazu, yet they still haunt me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu reached out, covering her hand with his. &ldquo;Nightmares? For that long? Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me, Sheeta?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta took a deep breath, as if gathering the courage to release the pain that plagued her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">&ldquo;I&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t want to worry you. But every night I see the faces of those soldiers, the ones who died because of </span><span class="c6">his</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">madness. I hear their cries, see the destruction, experience the kidnapping over and over again&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She began to shake, tears rolling down her eyes as terrible scenes from her dreams replayed themselves in her mind. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And sometimes&hellip;sometimes, I see you, Pazu, dying in my place, sacrificing yourself for me! I wake up terrified, thinking I&#39;ve lost you forever.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu&rsquo;s grip on her hand tightened reassuringly. &ldquo;Sheeta&hellip;I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve been so oblivious to your suffering. Please don&rsquo;t bottle up these sorts of feelings. You don&rsquo;t have to face your fears by yourself anymore. We can get through this together.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta looked up, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. &ldquo;I just&hellip;I feel so weak. You&rsquo;re always having to help me, and&hellip;I don&rsquo;t want to see you get hurt.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu pulled her into a gentle embrace. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t weak, Sheeta. You&rsquo;re one of the strongest girls I know. And there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with relying on my help. I&rsquo;m here for you, and I&rsquo;ll always be by your side.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta leaned into him, allowing his comfort to dry her tears. She managed a small smile, her voice hoarse as she spoke. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Pazu&hellip;thank you.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu nodded silently, rubbing her hand with gentle movements. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They sat like that for a while, finding solace in their shared silence. Sheeta couldn&rsquo;t help but feel flushed as she held him close. It was becoming clear to her that Pazu was an irreplaceable existence for her very soul. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a few minutes, the boarding announcement for their airship echoed through the terminal, pulling them from their thoughts. They hesitantly stood and made their way to the gate. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The massive, majestic airship greeted them, and as previous events continued to ruminate in their minds, they ascended towards their gateway into the unknown. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.ky3c8plc10yj"><span class="c15">Chapter III - Long Ride in an Airship</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To describe Pazu and Sheeta&rsquo;s cabin arrangements as lavish would be an understatement. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xu certainly spared no shortage of expenses in procuring the best room available. After all, they had the most expensive one. First class travel on an airship in this day and age was a pipe-dream, especially for people like Pazu and Sheeta. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But they had the tickets, so naturally they got a once-in-a-lifetime experience. For Sheeta, airships like these only reminded her of bad memories, but with a room this great, she couldn&rsquo;t quite complain either. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lots of walking space, full sized beds, and individual bathrooms were just a few of the great inclusions. That wasn&rsquo;t even including the premium room service and discounts on other paid amenities. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet something about this was bugging them&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why were they in one room together? They didn&rsquo;t expect such a development, and even though their cabin was large, it was still smaller than any of the rooms in Sheeta&rsquo;s house. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu glanced around, clearly trying to ignore the awkwardness that hung in the air. &ldquo;Well, this is&hellip;nice, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta nervously fiddled with her fingers, her cheeks red. &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s certainly&hellip;cozy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Quietly and robotically, they unpacked their belongings, intentionally avoiding eye contact with each other. It was funny, really&mdash;how once ordinary words became so loaded after they became aware of one other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu took off his vest and settled on one of the beds. There was certainly a difference between first class and regular bedding. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey&hellip;why do you suppose we only got one room?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I guess Xu must have thought we&rsquo;d prefer staying together.&rdquo; Sheeta suggested with a shrug. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip;strange. I mean, it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re&hellip;you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta looked out the window, feeling heat rise in her cheeks. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;...right.&rdquo; she muttered. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next few hours passed in what felt like many long years. There were a few tasks that kept them busy, like Sheeta writing in a journal she had recently started, and Pazu fiddling with some mechanical devices he decided to bring. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was peaceful, and you certainly wouldn&rsquo;t see either of them complaining about that fact. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of calming up here, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Pazu said, breaking the silence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta nodded, her gaze rather distant. &ldquo;Yes, it is. I&rsquo;m not entirely used to it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu chuckled. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s understandable. The last time we were on an airship, things were&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dangerous. Busy. Tiring,&rdquo; Sheeta interjected, finishing his words. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;but that&rsquo;s all behind us now!&rdquo; Pazu exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta smiled faintly, looking out at the nighttime clouds. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.pryu5a1o2hz5"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Pazu&hellip;&rdquo; her voice was soft, almost non-existent.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.1atxviukg764"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo; Pazu turned to her curiously.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.5fhv1ju1l9bm"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I met you,&rdquo; she said, her cheeks flushing.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.c5y8t349b7q1"><span class="c0">Pazu rubbed the back of his head sheepishly. &ldquo;W-where&rsquo;s this coming from?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.q5waaj646pye"><span class="c0">Sheeta turned away, trying to hide the deepening red on her face. &ldquo;I just wanted to tell you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.32z9tgso5n2w"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, er&hellip;well, I feel the same way&hellip;&rdquo; he stammered, equally flustered.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.n4kub32794is"><span class="c0">An awkward silence settled between them, filled only by the buzz of the airship&rsquo;s engines.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.erbgwkdl049h"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sheeta&hellip;um&hellip;could you see us living together forever?&rdquo; Pazu&rsquo;s voice was hesitant, but there was a genuine look of hope in his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.bf7jfzpytzp9"><span class="c0">&ldquo;F-forever?&rdquo; Sheeta&rsquo;s heart raced at the brazen question.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.f85u9kft3on9"><span class="c0">&ldquo;W-well, we&rsquo;re close, right? So making things more permanent wouldn&rsquo;t be that far-fetched&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.yb6sc9j7q9qo"><span class="c0">Sheeta fidgeted, her mind swirling. &ldquo;I&hellip;wouldn&rsquo;t mind that&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.1mrqmyr8zg2r"><span class="c0">The silence that followed was so profound that it seemed to swallow all other sounds, making the room feel even more intimate.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.ecedvg7vz4oo"><span class="c0">Pazu reached out, taking her hand in his. &ldquo;Sheeta, I know things have been tough, but being with you is wonderful! I want us to build a future together, somehow, someway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.w7emx7bcz3ha"><span class="c0">Sheeta looked into his eyes, seeing the sincerity and warmth there. Her nervousness began to fade, however slightly. &ldquo;I want that too, Pazu. More than anything. But I&rsquo;m afraid to put it into words.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.pv5pxbjgto4f"><span class="c0">Pazu smiled, with a look of understanding. He gently pulled her closer, their bodies touching. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. You don&rsquo;t have to say anything right now, Sheeta. I&rsquo;ll wait for as long as you want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.gqlhpwnp2lm1"><span class="c0">Sheeta gave an expression of relief and settled into his arms.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.rsms2gmio69n"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you. And sorry, for being so indecisive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.zk51dxjsoh"><span class="c0">Their sanguine moment was interrupted by a gentle chime, signaling the start of the meal service. The cabin crew moved down the aisle, directing passengers towards the dining hall. Pazu and Sheeta reluctantly followed, only realizing later at the table that their hands were still entwined.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.wuqat9m0ews"><span class="c0">They stared at each other for a second before chuckling to themselves.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.ojkbhjgpmqhm"><span class="c0">As they shared a quiet meal, the countryside below gave way to endless views of mountains and oceans. These were sights they hadn&rsquo;t seen since two years ago.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.6pucpeabozx4"><span class="c0">Pazu glanced out the window, then back at Sheeta. &ldquo;Do you think going to Eterna is the right choice?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.vuoh99uecbxy"><span class="c0">Sheeta took a deep breath, her gaze steady. &ldquo;I hope so. But even if it isn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re here, and that&rsquo;s enough for me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.9pnz3pxdhy8b"><span class="c0">Pazu took a sheepish sip of his drink, trying to hide his embarrassment. &ldquo;O-of course, yeah. Together we&rsquo;ll figure out what&rsquo;s going on, no matter what happens.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.11wiy296bp8l"><span class="c0">They finished their meal in comfortable silence, occasionally exchanging glances filled with unspoken feelings of longing.</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c9" id="h.m294vfvvwdeq"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1" id="h.q9kjqjjllexz"><span class="c0">On day two of their journey, time passed quicker than it did on the first. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.otgcmu3pc337"><span class="c0">They continued to find ways to pass the hours, and enjoyed each other&rsquo;s company, and before they knew it, night had come. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.ymsqiqefibkr"><span class="c0">That night, Sheeta and Pazu found themselves in a secluded alcove overlooking the sky below. The little table they shared was tight, close, and extremely personal. The dinner they were served was highly luxurious and surrounded by candle light. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.pmrsjhpnn0yf"><span class="c0">Their server approached them with a tray of questionable drinks. &ldquo;Compliments of the captain,&rdquo; he said with a smile, setting down two glasses filled with a sweet-smelling liquid, &ldquo;As part of your travel package.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.aye372q34lz8"><span class="c0">A wiser, more seasoned individual might immediately recognize the scent as distinctly alcoholic, but Pazu and Sheeta had no experience with that. They had some suspicions, but couldn&rsquo;t quite say for sure. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.udz8p6rmi3mc"><span class="c0">Pazu took a cautious sip and grinned. &ldquo;This is good, but insanely strong! Try it, Sheeta.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.xon51y2ygod9"><span class="c0">Sheeta sipped her drink, her eyes widening at the taste. &ldquo;It is! I wonder what this is called.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.qg2tyxea9dac"><span class="c0">They drank and chatted, the conversation flowing easily, though slowly their words became more and more slurred. After a while, they were both filled with a giddy warmth. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.kulxbcbf8zqp"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling sort of fuzzy&hellip;&rdquo; Pazu muttered, laughing.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.tq7lc4svntoi"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Pazu&hellip;I think&hellip;those drinks were&hellip;alcoholic&hellip;&rdquo; Sheeta said, her words slow. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.nupg9a7f81rp"><span class="c0">Pazu placed a hand on her own. &ldquo;Sheeta&hellip;are you alright?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.31l5e27pd6r6"><span class="c0">Sheeta swayed, feeling sleepy and woozy. She rested her head on Pazu&rsquo;s shoulder, her voice now barely even a whisper. &ldquo;Pazu&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.44l2nysgg391"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.yppifmrfy1cc"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Pazu&hellip;promise you won&rsquo;t leave me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.4lskvbe321dc"><span class="c0">Pazu rubbed her hair fondly with a smile. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.z6d65dyndbq"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I promise. I wouldn&rsquo;t ever dream of leaving you.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.71b2urafki0l"><span class="c0">He gently and carefully helped her to her feet, guiding her back to their cabin. Sheeta&rsquo;s steps were unsteady, and she clung to Pazu for support, nearly falling asleep as she did so. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.igshrdqj8o4j"><span class="c0">Once inside, Pazu lifted her off her feet and laid her down on one of the beds. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.o9ngzn5vhvk5"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Pazu&hellip;stay with me&hellip;&rdquo; she murmured, sleep threatening to overtake her. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.583olpv5kura"><span class="c0">Pazu smiled, sitting down beside her. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to tell me twice.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.hqion9viknae"><span class="c0">Before he could say anything else, she suddenly pulled him down with her. Though this situation was extremely risky, Pazu was too tired to argue. </span></p><p class="c1" id="h.urpvwm4oenx5"><span class="c0">Slowly, they drifted off to sleep, their hands locked tightly together&hellip;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c16 c25" id="h.7037x4fzd6nx"><span class="c15"></span></h2><h2 class="c16 c25" id="h.26tjw6ahj9ag"><span class="c15"></span></h2><h2 class="c16 c25" id="h.1h07ah2wkzho"><span class="c15"></span></h2><p class="c5"><span class="c17 c19"></span></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.t3q9cq2puzbf"><span class="c15">Chapter IV - Distant Descendants</span></h2><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Pazu woke drowsily, blinking against the morning light that shined through the cabin window. His head throbbed, a slight hangover acting as a reminder of the events from the night before. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">He shifted and felt warmth beside him&mdash;Sheeta, who was sleeping with a peaceful expression on her face. Pazu brushed away a lock of hair and smiled.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You look so cute when you sleep.&rdquo; he whispered. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Slowly, memories from the previous night began to flood back, causing him to feel a wave of embarrassment. They had actually fallen asleep together&hellip;it seemed unbelievable, but it actually happened. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Of course, he didn&rsquo;t plan on things ending up like that, but the feeling of warmth, the atmosphere of that alcove, and the sweetness of the drinks made everything feel&hellip;right.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Carefully removing himself from the bed, Pazu glanced at Sheeta one more time before heading to the bathroom to freshen up. Coincidentally, she had just woken up once he was in the other room. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta sat up slowly, rubbing her eyes. She held her head, feeling the after effects from alcohol. Then she looked at the bed where Pazu once was and felt an odd sense of emptiness. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">The bed felt cold without his presence. &ldquo;Pazu?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">After a few minutes, Pazu returned, holding two cups of tap water. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re awake. Good morning, Sheeta.&rdquo; he said, handing one of the cups.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta took it without complaint and drank the entire thing. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good morning&hellip;&rdquo; she muttered, her voice still thick with sleep. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You look sleepy.&rdquo; Pazu laughed.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta groaned, standing up from the bed. &ldquo;I am sleepy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">They stared at each other, feeling the embarrassment from the previous night reemerging with every passing second. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry about last night&hellip;&rdquo; Sheeta muttered, her face red. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Pazu chuckled sheepishly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it&hellip;we were both at fault&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">They dressed and prepared themselves in silence, each lost in their own burning thoughts. Finally, Pazu broke the awkward silence. &ldquo;Sheeta, are you ready for what we&rsquo;ll see?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta nodded nervously. &ldquo;I guess so. I&rsquo;m a little worried, but&hellip;we can&rsquo;t turn back now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Pazu smiled and held out his hand. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta took a deep breath and then nodded. &ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</span></p><hr><p class="c8 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">As Sheeta and Pazu descended from the airship, they were greeted by a strange sense of deja-vu. Though it had been two years since they left Laputa, the current sights were eerily similar to what they remembered. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">The large city of Eterna seemed to stretch far into the distance, populated by over a thousand impressive buildings built from another time, a distant time, an ancient time hundreds of years before Sheeta and Pazu were even born.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Though there seemed to be a modern edge as a result of the passage of time, there was no doubt that the structures of these buildings were made many, many years ago. The architecture seemed even beyond modern times, an advanced style that was again similar to something Sheeta and Pazu had known. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">They had seen it before in Laputa. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">In fact, everywhere they looked, they saw the familiar symbol of Laputa, though slightly altered from its normal form. It was adorned on banners, storefronts, even the slightly unusual clothing of the city&rsquo;s inhabitants. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that symbol again&hellip;the symbol on your necklace&hellip;&rdquo; Pazu mused aloud, glancing around nervously. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta frowned, her brow furrowing. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">She rummaged in her pocket and held up the remnants of her necklace. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. It&rsquo;s slightly different from what I can make out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">As they walked through the city, they soon found themselves in the midst of a huge market. Stands lined the roads, laden with fresh produce, colorful candies, and an absurd assortment of gifts, ranging from playful to heartfelt. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">The air was filled with the chatter and laughter of all those present. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; Pazu asked, marveling at the atmosphere. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">A passing local overhead him and grinned. &ldquo;Welcome visitors! Today marks the first day of the annual Celebration of the Eternals&mdash;a week long festival honoring our city&rsquo;s history and prosperity.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta&rsquo;s eyes lit up with curiosity. &ldquo;Celebration of the Eternals?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">The local nodded enthusiastically. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s a joyful time for feasting, merriment, and honoring our ancestors, the Great Eternals. This festival is for all to experience, so don&rsquo;t hold back!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta and Pazu exchanged a glance, their initial awkwardness fading as the excitement of the festival overtook them. But they couldn&rsquo;t forget that they were invited here to begin with. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Where was their host?</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta looked to Pazu with a conflicted expression.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What should we do, Pazu?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Pazu glanced around the area. &ldquo;Probably wait for Xu, but&hellip;I don&rsquo;t see him anywhere.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I think&hellip;I think we should see the festival. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s in the middle of it somewhere.&rdquo; Sheeta suggested. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Pazu wanted to disagree, but a part of him really wanted to see what the festival had to offer. In the end, he couldn&rsquo;t stop his eagerness. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright. Let&rsquo;s go explore!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">They smiled and took each other&rsquo;s hand, heading forth into the maelstrom of the festival.</span></p><hr><p class="c8 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta and Pazu wandered through the market, sampling and viewing exotic foods, admiring handmade crafts, and breathing in the vibrant atmosphere. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">The wonder and color was unlike anything they had ever seen, and the feelings in the air were so cheerful, they couldn&rsquo;t help but feel happier than they ever had before. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">At one particularly shiny looking stand, Sheeta took interest in a variety of beautiful jewelry on display. Pazu noticed her interested gazes and picked up a delicate bracelet adorned with a small Laputa emblem.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you like this one, Sheeta?&rdquo; he asked with a genuine smile.. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta hesitated for a moment, a deep red growing on her face, then nodded. &ldquo;&hellip;I do. I like it very much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Pazu chuckled and purchased the bracelet for her, fastening it around her arm. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It looks nice on you.&rdquo; he complimented. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta quickly spun around, desperately hiding the flush that was overtaking her.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;T-thank you&hellip;I appreciate you buying it for me.&rdquo; she murmured.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">A similar thing happened at another stand, which was full of intricately carved wooden figures. Sheeta spotted and purchased a small bird figure, remembering Pazu&rsquo;s old home and the birds that had kept him company before they met. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Here, for you,&rdquo; she said, handing it to him with a shy smile. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Pazu&rsquo;s heart swelled and he felt a wave of emotion. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been so long&hellip;I had forgotten them&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">He suddenly hugs Sheeta, whose eyes go wide in surprise.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you, Sheeta.&rdquo; he muttered. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">They continued exploring, their laughter becoming a part of the general cheer of the festival. As they walked hand in hand, Pazu&rsquo;s affection for Sheeta never felt any stronger. His feelings grew with each passing moment, each moment of happiness, each moment of subtle tender action that Sheeta made. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Finding a quiet spot near an old fountain and sitting down, they enjoyed a brief respite of peace amid the bustling festivities. Pazu glanced at Sheeta, his heart pounding heavily in his chest. He felt like he was ready. He felt like he wanted to tell her what he was feeling, what he wanted from their future, what he had been agonizing over for so long. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Taking a deep breath, he turned to her. &ldquo;Sheeta&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta looked over at him, her eyes curious and searching. &ldquo;Yes, Pazu?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Pazu hesitated, the words on the tip of his tongue. He had to say it now. Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to muster the courage again. The time was right. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Why couldn&rsquo;t he say it?</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">However, before he could speak, their merriment was interrupted by the arrival of a jolly boy, who seemed to be similar in age to Pazu. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, there you are!&rdquo; he exclaimed, approaching them with his arms open wide. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting so long to meet you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Pazu and Sheeta exchanged a puzzled look as the boy took Sheeta&rsquo;s hand eagerly and smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Xuciano, but you can call me Xu,&rdquo; he introduced, his voice full of warmth. &ldquo;You must be Lucita, and I see you&rsquo;ve brought a guest!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta blinked in stunned surprise, her hand still in Xu&rsquo;s grasp. &ldquo;Um, nice to meet you, Xuciano. This is my good friend, Pazu.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see. My name is Xuciano, Pazu. Welcome to Eterna.&rdquo; said Xu, shaking Pazu&rsquo;s hand excitedly. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Pazu felt awkward holding his hand, but he managed a smile. &ldquo;Thanks for having me!&rdquo;</span></p><hr><p class="c8 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">As they walked through the crowded streets of Eterna, Xuciano chatted animatedly with Pazu and Sheeta. He explained that he became aware of Sheeta&rsquo;s existence through rumors and eventually confirmed his findings. He invited Sheeta with the intent of getting to know her. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">He also tells them more about the city and its deep history. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This city was founded by my ancestors,&rdquo; Xuciano explained as he led them toward a lavish building decorated with ornate carvings and colorful banners. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve kept the spirit of Laputa alive here in Eterna for many centuries.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Inside, the interior was just as grand as the outside had promised. Sheeta and Pazu were ushered into a cozy sitting room filled with red cushioned chairs and a table adorned with pre-poured refreshments.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you were both able to come,&rdquo; Xuciano said warmly. &ldquo;Sheeta, do you still possess your family&rsquo;s heirloom?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta nodded, pulling out the remnants of the necklace that had saved her many times in the past. &ldquo;I still have it, but the power no longer works.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, then the spell of destruction must have used all of the energy contained inside it,&rdquo; Xuciano theorized, studying the cracked crystal intently. &ldquo;Sheeta, this necklace is a symbol of your heritage, correct?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s been in my family for many generations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Xuciano smiled warmly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see that it&rsquo;s still with you, even if the power is broken. It means a lot to us, you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Pazu eyed him, intrigued. &ldquo;Why is Laputa so valued here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Xuciano chuckled. &ldquo;Let me show you something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">He led them to a massive hall of artifacts and heirlooms, showing them a large tapestry that lined one of the walls. The tapestry was decorated with images of Laputa and its many wonders.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My ancestors were distant relatives of the Laputian Royal Family.&rdquo; He explained. &ldquo;They settled here when the ancient city&rsquo;s power began to wane. However, they didn&rsquo;t want to abandon the knowledge and culture of Laputa, so they founded Eterna.&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta listened intently, feeling a mix of awe and disbelief. &ldquo;But why keep the symbols and traditions alive if Laputa is gone?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Xuciano&rsquo;s expression softened. &ldquo;Because even though Laputa has ascended far beyond us, its legacy lives on its people and artifacts like your family&rsquo;s heirloom. We believe deeply in the power and wisdom of our ancestors. It&rsquo;s kept us living for this long without any conflicts.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta was taken aback. &ldquo;You know about Laputa&rsquo;s ascension?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">He nodded solemnly. &ldquo;We in Eterna can feel when Laputa is near. When it ascended, that connection was severed. The stars were bright that day. But even though Laputa is gone, its memory lives on in all of our hearts.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Pazu glanced between them, sensing how heavy the conversation had become. &ldquo;So this city is built on long held Laputian ideals?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Xuciano nodded enthusiastically. &ldquo;Exactly! That&rsquo;s the reason we celebrate the Eternals&mdash;our descendants, the ones who came from Laputa, were responsible for keeping the heritage and culture alive that we hold so dear.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta absorbed this information, her mind racing with serious questions. &ldquo;Xu&hellip;what do you want from me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Xuciano&rsquo;s face hardened and he turned to stare up at the tapestry. &ldquo;I want to continue the legacy of Laputa. And Sheeta, as Princess Lucita, you are the true heir to the Laputian Royal Family.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta blinked in surprise. &ldquo;But&hellip;how do you know that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Xuciano smiled gently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve studied Laputa&rsquo;s history many times. Your family has clear ties to the ancient royalty. From all that I&rsquo;ve learned, you are the only one who&rsquo;s truly suited to lead us forward, to rediscover the knowledge we lost.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta felt overwhelmed by his mission. It was certainly beyond anything she had expected. &ldquo;I&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m capable of that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Xuciano placed a hand on her shoulder, his expression kind. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to decide now, Sheeta. This is an important decision, so take your time thinking about it, alright?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;...alright.&rdquo; Sheeta muttered.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we think about this over some food?&rdquo; Pazu suggested, sensing her turbulent feelings. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta nodded. &ldquo;I am feeling pretty hungry. Let&rsquo;s go have some dinner.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Great idea!&rdquo; Xuciano exclaimed, taking them by the hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask my chefs to prepare a great feast for us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">As they followed behind him, Sheeta pondered over his proposition. It was bold, demanding, and rather audacious. Yet, there were also parts of it that seemed honorable and logical. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta was conflicted. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Xuciano&rsquo;s plan was somewhat appealing, but if she chose to go down that path, what would happen to Pazu? Would she never see him again? </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta felt someone grab her hand. She looked up to see Pazu staring at her with a worried look on his face. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking about his plan, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;...yeah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">He caressed her hand softly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s plenty of time to consider a proper decision. If you spend the entire rest of the day thinking about that and nothing else, you&rsquo;ll burn yourself out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta was reluctant. &ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Trust me. We have lots of time to ponder on this. Besides, whatever you decide, I&rsquo;ll be here for you and support your choice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Sheeta smiled at him gratefully, his words being just what she needed. &ldquo;Thank you, Pazu.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">They stared at each other affectionately and went off to enjoy their dinner. </span></p><p class="c8 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c8 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.aqurcfbc15xw"><span class="c15">Chapter V - A Paramount Decision</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The dining hall of Xuciano&rsquo;s home was nothing short of elegant. Crystal chandeliers, three in total, cast a warm glow throughout the room, which was so large, one could probably fit two small houses within it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu and Sheeta sat at the end of a long table, made up of an expensive, high quality cedar. They both felt slightly out of place amidst the gold flourishes and ornate decorations. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano noticed their looks and chuckled, pouring some wine into their glasses. &ldquo;Relax, you two. I know this room may portray me as vain, but it&rsquo;s been this way for generations. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind any of it too much.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta shook her head. &ldquo;No, no, it&rsquo;s fine. We were just surprised.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano nodded thoughtfully. &ldquo;I understand. The ancients placed great value on their gold. It&rsquo;s probably one of the main reasons why Laputa ultimately failed,&rdquo; he said, his expression growing dark. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s not dwell on such depressing matters right now. We have dinner to enjoy!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">As they settled into their chairs, Pazu had a strange feeling that there was something more to Xuciano&rsquo;s plans for Sheeta. Maybe he </span><span class="c6">was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;acting with genuine intentions, but what if this was more a selfish request than an ernest one?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He sighed. No, he couldn&rsquo;t let his own personal gripes get in the way of this. Xu was Sheeta&rsquo;s relative after all. What harm could come to her?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu allowed his thoughts to subside as he observed the opulent feast that was laid before them. Freshly cooked vegetables, a succulent roast, and other exotic dishes were just some of the outrageous options placed upon the table. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wasting no time getting to the food, the room was soon filled with the sound of clinking forks and merry feasting. Sheeta turned to Xuciano, starting a conversation as she ate without restraint. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Xuciano, your city has been really wonderful. Thanks for inviting us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano smiled, taking a sip of wine. &ldquo;Of course, of course! I&rsquo;ve been so eager to talk with you like this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu felt a pang of unease in his stomach. He didn&rsquo;t particularly care for the intensity at which Xuciano was looking at her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Xu, you told us you wish to continue Laputa&rsquo;s legacy, right? How are you intending on doing this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano leaned backward slightly, his expression meek. &ldquo;Ah&hellip;I was meaning to explain the specifics later, but&hellip;I suppose some explanations are in order,&rdquo; he said, turning to Sheeta. &ldquo;The crux of my plan stems from&hellip;let&rsquo;s just say&hellip;&rsquo;mixing&rsquo; our blood.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta eyed him in confusion. &ldquo;...our blood?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">Pazu gulped. He wasn&rsquo;t fully certain, but he had a pretty good idea of where this was heading. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano shifted embarrassingly in his seat. &ldquo;Yes, our blood. Sheeta, as the direct heir to the royal throne, you have about eighty-to-ninety percent pure Laputian blood flowing through you. Likewise, I have the distant twenty percent less-pure Laputian blood flowing through me. In order to truly continue the line of the ancestors, we would need to produce a child that has one hundred percent pure blood. I invited you here with the intent of us being wed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The words hung in the air, and Pazu felt a cold chill run down his spine. An unknown feeling of anger was building up inside him, though he wished it wasn&rsquo;t. He glanced nervously at Sheeta, who looked totally shocked, her eyes wide. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Sheeta began, her voice wavering. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about this, Xu&hellip;getting married&hellip;and producing a child&hellip;that&rsquo;s too much for me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano nodded understandingly. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s a lot to take in, Sheeta. And I want you to understand that this entirely your choice. We don&rsquo;t have to produce an heir, Eterna is flourishing plenty without it, but for Laputa&rsquo;s legacy, the option is available. I just believe that our shared heritage could bring new life to the world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu&rsquo;s fists clenched under the table, his inner anger leaking out despite his attempts to contain it. &ldquo;And what if she doesn&rsquo;t want to? What if we think the past is meant to be left behind?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano eyed him with a knowing look. &ldquo;You make a good point, Pazu. But I also believe Laputa can make up for the mistakes it created in the past.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">Sheeta glanced between them, feeling torn. &ldquo;I need some more time to think about this.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano smiled. &ldquo;Of course, Sheeta. Take all the time you need. Now let&rsquo;s enjoy our meal.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The rest of dinner passed in silence, a tense atmosphere reigning over everything. The delicious food was fulfilling, but did little to ease the feelings of discomfort that everyone felt. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was no surprise that they all felt relieved when dinner was finally over. </span></p><hr><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano led Pazu and Sheeta to the sleeping quarters, which was a lot more cozy and modest compared to the other rooms in the house. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where you two will sleep. Sheeta, this is your room on the left. Pazu, this is your room on the right. Ring the bell on the door if you need anything. Goodnight.&rdquo; he said, heading for his own room. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo; they responded in unison. They eyed their separated rooms with looks that were indiscernible to each other. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well&hellip;goodnight, Pazu.&rdquo; Sheeta said softly, before hugging him tightly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu held her close, hesitant to let her go. &ldquo;...goodnight, Sheeta.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Reluctantly, they parted ways, heading for their respective rooms in silence. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">An hour passed, and Pazu lay awake in his bed, staring up at the ceiling. The conversations from earlier replayed in his mind, tormenting him to no end. He couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling of jealousy that had been building in his heart ever since that moment. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu groaned, trying to force sleep upon himself. Nothing was working, yet his eyes were tired and weary. Why couldn&rsquo;t he just go to sleep?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just as he was about to give up on sleep entirely, there was a soft knock on the door. He opened it to find Sheeta standing there, looking both restless and shy. &ldquo;Pazu,&rdquo; she whispered, avoiding eye contact, &ldquo;Can I stay with you tonight?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without a single word, Pazu stepped aside, and Sheeta slipped carefully into the room. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Someone might say something,&rdquo; he warned, though he too wanted her to stay with him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta gently pulled him onto the bed and wrapped the covers around them both. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; she breathed. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu&rsquo;s face went red, and he wondered whether this would truly help him sleep or make things worse. But eventually, the familiar comfort of each other&rsquo;s presence allowed them to soothe their minds, and the solace of closeness sent them drifting off into a peaceful slumber. </span></p><hr><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next morning, Xuciano was waiting for them in the main lounge. &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he greeted them cheerfully. He eyed Pazu with a knowing look. &ldquo;Pazu, would you mind running an errand for me? There&rsquo;s a special item I need from the market.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu&rsquo;s eyes narrowed slightly, sensing something deeper to this request. Was he being sent away, or was there legitimately something he needed to retrieve? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Forgoing his apprehension, he nodded hesitantly. &ldquo;Sure, I can do that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Perfect!&rdquo; Xuciano exclaimed. &ldquo;I need you to head to this address. There should be a package under my name.&rdquo; He handed Pazu a small piece of paper. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Pazu left, Xuciano turned to Sheeta with a bright smile. &ldquo;Shall we continue our conversation from last night? I know we left things on a conflicting note, but I&rsquo;d like to tell you more about my mission.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta nodded. &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano led her to an outdoor garden, populated with various species of plants, exotic flowers, and plentiful crops.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is one of the driving factors behind my plan,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Currently speaking, Eterna stands as a pinnacle of harvesting and food supply. We never run out of food to give our people, and we intend to keep things that way. However, other villages, towns, and cities aren&rsquo;t as fortunate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta frowned. &ldquo;But how can I, or my hypothetical child for that matter, help with that?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano pointed at a large tree growing in the center. &ldquo;See this tree? There&rsquo;s one just like it growing within Laputa. We&rsquo;ve only seen it in second-hand photographs, but just that fact alone means that our ancestors were capable of agricultural feats that no society has matched.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">Sheeta&rsquo;s eyes went wide. She walked over to the tree, gently feeling its large trunk in awe. &ldquo;There </span><span class="c6">was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a tree, a massive one&hellip;its roots saved our lives when we used the spell of destruction&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano nodded. &ldquo;Just think if we were able to use Laputa&rsquo;s knowledge and methods to grow large amounts of produce. We could supply the entire world for decades, even centuries, to come!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta turned to him, a new sense of understanding building within her. &ldquo;So the reason you want me is because&hellip;you want to help the people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, that is my goal. Laputa&rsquo;s knowledge has the potential to bring peace and advancements that could improve countless societies, from distant countries to poor small villages,&rdquo; he explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silence passed over them as Sheeta took in his genuine words. She was impressed by his selflessness and eagerness to prioritize the health of the people. The idea of joining his cause was seeming more and more appealing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Say, Sheeta, tell me more about Laputa. What was it like?&rdquo; Xuciano asked curiously. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta&rsquo;s eyes softened with nostalgia. &ldquo;It was beautiful. The robots tended to the garden, protected everything, even maintained the resting place of our ancestors. There was wildlife I had never seen, exotic plantlife I never knew existed until then. Most of all, it was a place of pure, serene peace.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano listened intently, captivated by her heartfelt words. &ldquo;I wish I could have seen the great island myself,&rdquo; he said sadly. &ldquo;Muska visited our town once, seeking to voyage there, but he didn&rsquo;t care about any of Laputa&rsquo;s positive aspects. It was obvious from the beginning that he only had an interest in power. We were lucky to get rid of him.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta frowned at the mention of the notorious Muska. &ldquo;I hope I never hear his foul name again. Just thinking about him makes me upset.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for mentioning him, Sheeta,&rdquo; Xuciano quickly apologized, &ldquo;I just wanted to understand more about our island.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta chuckled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re only interested in the good of Laputa.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, Pazu returned from his errand, carrying a flat box. He found Xuciano and Sheeta deep in conversation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jealousy hit him like a rock, and he struggled to keep his emotions in check. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m back,&rdquo; he exclaimed, sounding somewhat casual. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano smiled at him. &ldquo;Welcome back, Pazu. I trust you found what I sent you for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, but what exactly is this?&rdquo; Pazu asked, studying the ornate box curiously. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I think you should hand it to Sheeta so she can open it,&rdquo; Xuciano suggested.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu did as he was told, and Sheeta proceeded to open the box carefully. She was shocked to find a stylish dress decorated in deep blue silk. &ldquo;A dress?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano nodded happily. &ldquo;Yes, I purchased it just before you got here. With the main day of the festival soon upon us, I wanted you to look nice for the occasion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu eyed him suspiciously and with a hint of anger. How dare Xu buy gifts for Sheeta like this?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh. That&rsquo;s a rather nice gift,&rdquo; he started, keeping his voice calm, &ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t Silk rather excessive in this situation?&rdquo; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano shook his head. &ldquo;Nothing is &lsquo;excessive&rsquo; for the heir of Laputa.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu rolled his eyes with a &lsquo;hmph&rsquo; and turned to look at the garden. &ldquo;So, what were you two discussing while I was conveniently sent away&mdash;uh, I mean, sent on an errand?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We were talking about Laputa. Xuciano says he wants to use the city&rsquo;s knowledge to provide food to the entire world.&rdquo; Sheeta explained. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">Pazu eyed Xuciano in disbelief. &ldquo;The </span><span class="c6">entire</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;world?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, the entire world, or at least, the entire world as we currently know it. My thought is that the key to unlocking Laputa&rsquo;s knowledge is having someone with strong Laputian blood. That is why I suggested producing an heir with Sheeta.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">Pazu&rsquo;s expression darkened. &ldquo;I think Laputa should be left in the past. The island is gone now, far outside of our reach. Even if you do produce an heir</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;(which certainly won&rsquo;t happen)</span><span class="c0">, there&rsquo;s no telling whether you&rsquo;ll be able to recreate the things we&rsquo;ve seen.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano&rsquo;s calm demeanor cracked for the first time, his smile now tainted with a dark edge. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re wrong, Pazu. I understand you may have some apprehensions, but as far as I can tell, this conversation has nothing to do with you. Sheeta and I are descendants, you are just someone who happened to save her a few times.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu grabbed him by the hem of his shirt. &ldquo;Were you there when she was being chased by pirates? Did you rescue her when everything was on fire and she was being hurt by Muska? I didn&rsquo;t think so! Who are you to force her back into this mess where her life will be at stake? Producing an heir will not happen on my watch, I guarantee it!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">Xuciano gave him an annoyed sneer. &ldquo;Even if you&rsquo;re angry at me, you can&rsquo;t deny that Laputa&rsquo;s knowledge could change this world for the better. Also, you seem awfully confident that Sheeta and I won&rsquo;t produce an heir. </span><span class="c6">Why is that, exactly</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu raised his hand, his anger reaching an all time high. &ldquo;Why you&mdash;!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta suddenly, stepped between them, an expression of anger on her face that surprised both of them. &ldquo;STOP IT, BOTH OF YOU! We need to think about these things CAREFULLY, without all of this STUPID! POINTLESS! IDIOTIC! FIGHTING!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everything went silent as the weight of her words reigned. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Pazu and Xuciano muttered in unison. </span></p><hr><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next few days were filled with tension. They could still feel the effects of the fight that had occurred, and it made things awkward between them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta balanced spending time with both Pazu and Xuciano, trying to ease the dire atmosphere. She couldn&rsquo;t help but feel herself drawn to Xuciano&rsquo;s charm and knowledge, but she also knew that she felt a deep connection with Pazu that was unavoidable. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano taught her many things about Laputa and Eterna that interested her. Yet, she felt a sense of discomfort with his plan and didn&rsquo;t think she wanted to produce an heir with him, or anyone else for that matter. It was just too early for that. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta sat in Pazu&rsquo;s room on the bed, frowning. &ldquo;This is hard,&rdquo; she muttered. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; Pazu asked, sitting beside her with a heavy sigh. &ldquo;I guess I haven&rsquo;t really helped, have I? Sorry for all of this&hellip;conflict.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta shook her head with a smile. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re just worried for me, Pazu. You always worry for me, and I&rsquo;m grateful for that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu rubbed the back of his head sheepishly. &ldquo;You know me well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta blushed. &ldquo;Of course I do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She leaned her shoulder against his, closing her eyes to think. Ever since they landed in Eterna, she had been faced with difficult decisions. What was the right choice?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What choice would make everyone equally satisfied?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She buried her face in his shoulder, groaning softly. &ldquo;Pazu, can we stay like this for a while?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu smiled and ruffled her hair affectionately. &ldquo;As long as you want.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They remained that way the rest of the night, eventually falling asleep in each other&rsquo;s arms once more. There were many challenging things to think about, but for now, those worries could wait until tomorrow.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.nsa6yhqoopws"><span class="c15">Chapter VI - Celebration of the Eternals</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The final night of the Celebration of the Eternals was definitely the grandest of them all. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A kaleidoscope of colors, sounds, and scents filled the air. Streets were alive with laughter, music, and the haggling of street vendors. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Though the previous few days were marked by ever growing conflict, Pazu and Xuciano forwent their disagreements to enjoy things. They were intent on not letting the night be overshadowed by tensions. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta was still rather confused, but as she walked along the festival roads with both boys by her side, she felt a strange sense of happiness. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps there was no point in picking one over the other. Why not have them both?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You guys sure do know how to celebrate.&rdquo; Pazu said, glancing to and fro at the various sights.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano smiled. &ldquo;Of course. This is something we pride ourselves on.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta giggled, the atmosphere of the night making her feel giddy. &ldquo;How charming.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They strolled to various stands, taking cursory glances at jewelry, trinkets, and unique foods. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Compared to when Pazu and Sheeta first arrived, there were probably ten times as many fanciful things to see. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano spotted one funny looking stand and led them there eagerly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Pazu, Sheeta, you should try these,&rdquo; he said slyly, handing them some green candies wrapped in lace. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu eyed him suspiciously. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the catch?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t one. I just want you to try it,&rdquo; he responded with a grin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Despite their apprehension, Sheeta and Pazu reluctantly popped the candy into their mouths. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yikes! So sour!&rdquo; Sheeta exclaimed, squinting her eyes and sticking out her tongue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s way too strong!&rdquo; Pazu winced. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano held his chest, laughing at their reactions. &ldquo;Haha! You should see your faces!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta glared at him playfully. &ldquo;You tricked us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still chuckling, he replied, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in good fun. Those candies are famously intense. I had to see how you&rsquo;d handle them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano&rsquo;s prank seemed to bring a new sense of joy, effectively pushing their past conflict to the back of their minds. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They enjoyed the festival without restraint, experiencing as many things as they could. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dancers performed intricate musical feats, musicians filled the air with hymns from the past, and children mimicked stories based in Laputian folklore. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then as things were coming to a close, Xuciano turned to Sheeta with a smile. &ldquo;Sheeta, as a final honor to our ancestors, I would like to ask you to sing a song for the people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta&rsquo;s eyes widened and she felt a flutter of nerves. &ldquo;Sing? In front of everyone?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure everyone would appreciate hearing the voice of Laputa&rsquo;s true heir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder. &ldquo;I believe you can do it, Sheeta. Why not give it a try?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Taking a deep breath, Sheeta nodded. &ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The crowd fell silent as Sheeta stepped onto the musical stage. She glanced back at her friends, who both gave her encouraging smiles. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um, hello everyone,&rdquo; she started, feeling nervous. &ldquo;My name is Lucita Toelle Ur Laputa.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The city square was filled with whispers, as the people shared words about her heritage. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am here because I wish to sing a song for you all.&rdquo; Closing her eyes, Sheeta began to sing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her melody wove stories of the flowers of spring, the warmth of summer, and the solitude of winter. Her voice, pure and youthful, carried far across the city. The heartfelt sentiment of her song spoke of looking beyond the desire of power and seeking the beauty of nature. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As her words danced in the air, the whole city seemed to glow. Sheeta&rsquo;s necklace, dormant for so long, began to shine with a soft, ethereal light. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The crowd was mesmerized, and for a brief moment, it felt as if Laputa itself was there with them, blessing the celebration. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu and Xuciano stood side by side, entranced by Sheeta&rsquo;s beauty, grace, loveliness, just everything about her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">&ldquo;She really </span><span class="c6">is</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the heir of Laputa,&rdquo; Xuciano muttered with a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu shook his head, also smiling. &ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s more than that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano gave him a knowing look and grinned. &ldquo;You love her, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu stepped backward in surprise. &ldquo;H-huh? W-what are you talking about?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to hide it, Paz. The way you look at her, it&rsquo;s clear as day,&rdquo; Xuciano laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You must be mistaken&hellip;&rdquo; Pazu muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Am I? Or are you simply afraid?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip;I&rsquo;m not afraid&hellip;&rdquo; Pazu started. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So admit that you feel for her?&rdquo; Xuciano asked slyly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a few seconds, Pazu nodded hesitantly. &ldquo;I guess I do. The only thing is&hellip;I&rsquo;m just worried about bothering her,&rdquo; he finally admitted. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano nodded. &ldquo;I understand. You want to be by her side, but you also think she may not feel the same way.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu frowned. &ldquo;&hellip;Yeah.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano threw an arm around his shoulder. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s how you feel, you should tell her. Even if she rejects you, it&rsquo;s better than keeping things hidden for the rest of your life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu stared at him, taking in his words. &ldquo;I&hellip;I never considered these kinds of things before&hellip;Is it really that easy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. Getting into love is simple. Maintaining that love is the more complicated part,&rdquo; Xuciano explained. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&hellip;I see.&rdquo;</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Returning to Xuciano&rsquo;s home, Sheeta found herself once again faced with the dilemma that plagued her ever since they arrived in Eterna.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano gently pulled her aside, his eyes serious. &ldquo;Sheeta, have you thought about my proposal?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta nodded, feeling a mix of both pressure and confidence. &ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu watched them, feeling uncomfortable and nervous about what she would say. Before he could hear anything else, he slipped out the house, wandering to a nearby hill to sit. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looked up at the night sky, which was peaceful, yet his heart felt heavy. Would Sheeta really choose him? Did he truly have anything to offer her?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He sighed, wishing he could be more for Sheeta. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why are you sitting out here?&rdquo; A familiar voice called out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu turned to see Sheeta standing there, her face illuminated by the moonlight. &ldquo;Sheeta, I didn&rsquo;t want to bother you&hellip;I&rsquo;ve already caused so many problems&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta walked over and sat beside him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not bothering me, Pazu. And those problems are behind us now.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu looked down, his heart aching. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy for you, you know&hellip;Xu can give you so much more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta shook her head, her eyes sincere. &ldquo;Pazu, I didn&rsquo;t choose Xuciano.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu&rsquo;s eyes widened in surprise. &ldquo;You&hellip;didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta hugged him from behind, hiding the red on her face. &ldquo;&hellip;I love you, Pazu.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu&rsquo;s breath caught in his throat. He turned to look at her, searching her eyes for any hint of doubt, but found only genuine affection.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sheeta&hellip;I&rsquo;ve always been drawn to you,&rdquo; he whispered, his voice soft. &ldquo;But I thought you wouldn&#39;t accept it.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta tightened her embrace, her voice firm. &ldquo;I accept everything about you, Pazu.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu felt a surge of happiness, his self doubt fading away in the face of her confession. He turned to face her fully placing a hand on her cheek. &ldquo;I love you too, Sheeta,&rdquo; he said, his voice breaking with emotion. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta smiled, tears in her eyes as she laughed joyfully. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I was so insecure about this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu laughed with her, his voice filled with elation and relief. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve both been so blind, haven&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta nodded. &ldquo;Yes, but now I can finally see you,&rdquo; she muttered, placing her hand over his lovingly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes, their hearts and feelings now bare and vulnerable. Slowly, they leaned in, their lips meeting in a soft kiss that sealed their love. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sky above was illuminated with sparks of blue and gold, but they didn&rsquo;t notice, lost in the midst of their moment. The celebration continued to unfold around them, but it felt distant, as if they were the only two people in the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that moment of tenderness, and as the final fireworks burst overhead, the Celebration of the Eternals came to a satisfying end. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c16" id="h.hpx0hw3w6ez3"><span class="c15">Chapter VII - The Legacy of Laputa</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The morning sun was bright on the day of Pazu and Sheeta&rsquo;s departure. The vibrant streets, now quiet after the festival&rsquo;s exuberant end, held a quiet, almost eerie atmosphere as the time for farewells approached. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu and Sheeta stood by the entrance of the airship that was responsible for their return journey, the previous night&rsquo;s events, romance and all, still fresh in their minds. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano approached them with a joyful smile, yet his eyes betrayed his own inner melancholy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sheeta, Pazu,&rdquo; he began, voice carrying a note of solemn feelings. &ldquo;I want to express how wonderful your company was these past few days.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano turned to Sheeta, frowning. &ldquo;I wish things could have turned out more like I hoped, but I could see that your heart wasn&rsquo;t in it with me, Sheeta.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta&rsquo;s eyes softened as she looked at him. She placed a hand on his shoulder apologetically. &ldquo;Xuciano, I&rsquo;m so sorry. I never wanted to hurt you. You&rsquo;ve been incredibly kind to us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano waved off her apology with a kind smile. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I understood from the beginning. It was obvious where your heart truly lay.&rdquo; He turned to Pazu. &ldquo;I wish you both all the happiness in the world. And Pazu&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He leaned into Pazu&rsquo;s ear, whispering. &ldquo;Take care of her, alright? Laputa&rsquo;s legacy is in your hands.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu chuckled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lot of pressure. But you can count on me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feeling satisfied that Pazu would keep Sheeta safe, Xuciano nodded. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now with that settled, there&rsquo;s just one more thing I wish to do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a sweeping gesture, he presented Sheeta with a large crate full of books and scrolls. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This a collection of Laputian knowledge tomes,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;They contain wisdom and stories that my ancestors compiled from the ancient city. I hope they provide more insight regarding our history.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta&rsquo;s eyes widened as she looked at the contents of the crate, a mix of awe and gratitude in her gaze. &ldquo;Thank you so much, Xuciano. I promise to cherish these. I&rsquo;ll also send you anything I learn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano smiled. &ldquo;I would appreciate that. Now Pazu, I have something for you as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He handed Pazu a small but intriguing box full of devices. &ldquo;Inside are some old pieces of Laputian technology. I thought you mind find them interesting to study and repair.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu accepted the box with a nod, his curiosity peaked. &ldquo;Thank you, Xu. I&rsquo;ll be sure to put them to good use!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A bell sounded above them, signaling the time for boarding. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano eyed them with a reluctant look. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s time for you both to board.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta wrapped her arms around him in a heartfelt hug. &ldquo;Xuciano, you&rsquo;ve been so amazing and kind. I&rsquo;ll always remember our time here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano embraced her warmly, holding her close for a moment to mask his somber expression. &ldquo;Take care, Sheeta and Pazu. I wish you safe travels back to Gondoa.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With their farewells said, and gifts loaded in advance, Pazu and Sheeta made their way into the airship, their hearts heavy with emotion at the thought of leaving behind a place that had become special to them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even Pazu, who was initially apprehensive of Xuciano, felt sad that they had to depart. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Pazu&hellip;&rdquo; Sheeta whispered. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t want to leave,&rdquo; she said sadly, her eyes filled with tears. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu hugged her, consoling. &ldquo;Neither do I. But we can always come back.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She nodded, holding him close as they ascended towards the clouds.</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xuciano stared up at the airship as it began its journey to Gondoa. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He held a hand over his heart, feeling a pang of sadness at having to let Sheeta go so easily. He knew she liked Pazu, but he still couldn&rsquo;t quite accept the development. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Paz, I&rsquo;m so envious&hellip;.&rdquo; he muttered sadly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It wasn&rsquo;t just because she was the heir to Laputa. He had fallen in love with her after seeing her lovely sides, her pure beauty, her genuine kindness. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How could someone not love such a girl?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget about me, Sheeta,&rdquo; he whispered, smiling weakly through his tears.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He rubbed his eyes with his hand, forcing his solemnity away as he turned to face the city.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">This isn&rsquo;t the time for emotions</span><span class="c0">, Xuciano thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For now he needed to take care of his people. &nbsp;</span></p><hr><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eterna faded into the distance, the city gradually becoming a faint silhouette against the pale horizon. Pazu and Sheeta gazed wistfully out the window, watching as the sun dipped lower in the sky, casting an orange glow over the clouds. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was sight that warmed their hearts and mirrored their feelings of hope. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hope that they would be together for as long as they lived. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hope that they could return to Eterna sometime in the future. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hope that their love for each other was true and enduring. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the airship sailed fluidly through the sky, Pazu reached for Sheeta&rsquo;s hand, giving it a gentle squeeze. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She turned to him, her eyes reflecting the light. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we can finally be honest with each other,&rdquo; she whispered with a smile. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu nodded. &ldquo;It feels so liberating.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta leaned her head on his shoulder, feeling peace and calm wash over her. &ldquo;I believe in us, Pazu.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we feel the same way.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The airship continued its stead course, the world below transforming as they traveled over familiar mountains and oceans. The sky was dipped in deep blue as evening fell upon them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They sat in comfortable silence on one of the ship&rsquo;s balconies, savoring the tranquility of the moment. Sheeta closed her eyes briefly, memories of past adventures with Pazu playing in her mind. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She thought back to Eterna, to the friend they had made, the conflicts they had faced, and the bond between them that had finally been formed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As night truly began, Pazu wrapped an arm around Sheeta, pulling her closer. &ldquo;Do you remember the last time we saw the stars like this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta nodded, a smile tugging at her lips. &ldquo;Of course. We were on the Tiger Moth, and you promised to bring me back to Gondoa when everything was over.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu chuckled softly. &ldquo;And I kept that promise, didn&rsquo;t I? Without it, we wouldn&rsquo;t be here like this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta&rsquo;s smile widened. &ldquo;Yes, you did. That promise brought us to this moment, under this beautiful sky.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu looked up at the stars, his thoughts drifting back to their prior journeys. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing how far we&rsquo;ve come since then. When I first met you, I never expected that my life would change this much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta closed her eyes, savoring the nighttime breeze. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been alone and always thought my life would remain that way. But when I met you, I felt so many new feelings for the first time. I&rsquo;m so thankful for you, Pazu.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu gave her a gentle kiss. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never be alone again, Sheeta. We&rsquo;ll be together through everything.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta blushed, and then looked out into the distance. &ldquo;Pazu&hellip;I want to raise a family with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu&rsquo;s eyes went wide in shock. &ldquo;...a family?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta nodded with a shameless smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought about it ever since Xuciano mentioned the legacy of Laputa. I know our child won&rsquo;t be a proper heir or anything, but I don&rsquo;t care about any of that. I just&hellip;want to be with you forever.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu thought over her words and then gave her a sheepish look. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t even considering such things&hellip;&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;But that would be pretty nice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta fiddled with her pigtails, losing herself in thoughts of the future. &ldquo;I want a simple family, Pazu. We can expand the house and raise them together. They can help us on the farm and we can make a living on our produce and animals,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;Then we can grow old and live out the rest of our lives in peace.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu nodded, her visions of the future playing out before him with every idea she proposed. &ldquo;A long life of happiness&hellip;I couldn&rsquo;t ask for anything better.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sheeta chuckled. &ldquo;And we have plenty of time to think about it. The future is still ahead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pazu pulled her toward him and kissed her a few times. She stared at him with eyes full of drunk love. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Pazu&hellip;&rdquo; she slowly muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. The future </span><span class="c6">is </span><span class="c0">still ahead, so why don&rsquo;t we focus on the present, hm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">&ldquo;...Okay.&rdquo; she whispered with a smile, her eyes locked firmly on his. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They cuddled up close, feeling each other&rsquo;s warmth amidst the cool of night. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They watched the shimmering evening stars in serene silence, the distant silhouette of Gondoa soon appearing before them, signaling their eventual return to the place they now called home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The world was vast and their future was just beginning, and together, they knew nothing could hold them back. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">For their love was, and will always be, eternal.</span></p></body></html>
